<Mega>
How did you know that?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Club.Strong>
With our "R" network, that
sort of thing isn't hard to
find out.

You've been targeted for
termination.

As such, I will make where
you stand, your grave.

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
So that means that if these
"R" guys and their master
<PUSH>
are at the root of all of
these incidents, then all we
<PUSH>
have to do is get buck wild
on these fools to get two
birds with one stone!
<PUSH>
Let's delete this guy and
get to the end of this
Noise Wave!
