CygnsWing"R"!
<PUSH>
Your boss, Sirius,
who is he!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{8B}{00}My master, Sirius, is the
magnificent administrator
<PUSH>
of the largest server
in the universe,
the Black Hole Server.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Black Hole Server!?
<PUSH>
You mean that black
hole is a server!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{8B}{00}That is correct.
<PUSH>
Sirius uses it to suck in
EM waves which he fancies,
<PUSH>
and uses all of that
data for his own power.

<Megaman>
Yeah, Meteor G...
Meteor G is a server too.

<NEW-DIALOG>
{8B}{00}Ho ho ho ho!
That's laughable!
<PUSH>
Compared to the Black Hole
Server, Meteor G amounts
<PUSH>
to nothing more than a
single folder!
<PUSH>
But, unfortunately, you'll
never be written to that
server.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
You got that right!
I don't plan on being sucked
up by any black hole!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{8B}{00}That's not why...
I'm going to delete you
<PUSH>
right here, {14}{E1}right now!
