t*beep, beep* Hello!
<PUSH>
This is where video
editing is performed!

I've even gotten to see
lots of Sonia Strumm's
outtakes!

<Megaman>
Umm... you wouldn't
happen to be Sonia Strumm's
lighting Wizard, would you?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{90}{00}Yes, I am. Why?
<PUSH>
The director is waiting for
me to get there, so they
can start filming?
<PUSH>
That's funny, I was told that
the director wanted me to
come here.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Who told you that?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{90}{00}That one Wizard, what's his
name...? I sometimes see him
around here... Darn, I forget.
<PUSH>
Well, I better hurry back!
Sonia's shoot can't start
without me.
<PUSH>
And, if the director fires me,
I'll never be able to work in
this business again.
<PUSH>
Sorry I couldn't remember
who that Wizard was.
Well, I have to go, bye.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Could this have been some
kind of prank against Sonia?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
What?
<PUSH>
I think you're reading too
much into it. It was probably
just a miscommunication.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Maybe...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
OK. Sonia's shoot is about
to start!
<PUSH>
We should probably rejoin
everybody backstage.
