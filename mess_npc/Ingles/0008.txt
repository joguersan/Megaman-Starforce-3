They say that the

detect the presence of

dangerous viruses,
and will display a
"WARNING" pop-up
<PUSH>
when a dangerous virus
is nearby.
<PUSH>
I've never actually seen
it. But that's probably
<PUSH>
because I don't have
a Wizard!

I just got this Battle

It can trap enemies in

Not just that, but did you

in a bubble with an Elec

twice the damage!?
