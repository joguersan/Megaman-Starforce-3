<Woody>
If you touch them, you will
be able to use them as
Support Use Cards.
<PUSH>
Single Use is also selectable.
That means the card can be
used as normal. But you
<PUSH>
can't pick any other cards
if you choose Single Use.
<PUSH>
Back to Support Use...
Each element activates a
different Support Use ability:
<PUSH>
Non-elemental = AreaEater
Fire Element = Attack+10
Aqua Element = Invisible
<PUSH>
Elec Element = ParlyzPlus
Wood Element = GrassStage
<PUSH>
Right now, we are going to
use the Non-elemental card
<PUSH>
Cannon. So the Support
Use will be AreaEater!
<PUSH>
AreaEater erases the
<PUSH>
front row, pulling the enemies
closer to you.
<PUSH>
First, touch Cannon and
select Support Use. Then
<PUSH>
pick BeastSlap1, followed
by the OK Button.
<PUSH>
