OK, let's begin the tutorial
program on the
"Multi-Noise Form".
<PUSH>
Multi-Noise Form is when
you fuse the power of two
Noise types into one form.
<PUSH>
The act of fusing two types
of Noise together is called
"Multi-Noising".
<PUSH>
It's really easy to do,
so take a look at the
bottom screen, eh?
<PUSH>

First, you must equip the
ability, "<AcePrgm>".
Don't forget to do that.
<PUSH>
Then, you select either a
Brother Card or an
<PUSH>
Opponent Noise from the
Custom Screen.
<PUSH>
So you know, you have to
pick a Brother Card or
<PUSH>
Opponent Noise that is a
different type of Noise than
you are.
<PUSH>

That's Multi-Noise Form
for you. Simple, eh?
But, oh yeah...
<PUSH>
When you select a Brother
Card or Opponent Noise, you
will be asked to either
<PUSH>
choose to perform a
Multi-Noise or roulette.
Understanding them is key.
<PUSH>
Roulette is when one of the
four White Cards the
Brother or Opponent has
<PUSH>
set is randomly selected and
given to you.
<PUSH>
But, roulette will occur
automatically if you are the
<PUSH>
same Noise type as the
Brother or Opponent.
<PUSH>
Upon Muti-Noising, you will
gain access to the power of
both Noise types.
<PUSH>
If you take a hit by an
elemental attack, you will
revert back to Noise Form.
<PUSH>
Your elemental weakness
will be the weakness of the
<PUSH>
Noise type you used to
Multi-Noise.
<PUSH>
The same goes for your
charged shot.
<PUSH>
That's it for the tutorial.
Hurry up and try
Multi-Noising!
<PUSH>

Wait a second...
Shouldn't you be Multi-Noising?
<PUSH>
You can't do it without
selecting a Brother Card
or an Opponent Noise.

Nice job!
You seem like you're used
to Multi-Noise Forms now.
<PUSH>
Multi-Noise Forms can be
really powerful, depending on
the Noise combination.
<PUSH>
Combine the types that work
well with your battling style!
<PUSH>
