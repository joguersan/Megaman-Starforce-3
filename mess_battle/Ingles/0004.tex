<Mega> Alright, next up I'll cover how to lock-on and the Mega Attack. 
Select two sword-type cards, will ya? 
<Mega> Hey, kid! Pick a card already! 
<Mega> I said sword-type cards! 
<Mega> Pick one more, kid! 
<Mega> Hey, kid! This is no time to run! 
<Mega> Alright, let's go! 
<Mega> You're ready, right? Good, it's explanation time. 
The Mega Attack is a combination attack between you and I. 
<Megaman> Yeah, I remember. 
First I press down on the +Control Pad, then I'll switch into lock-on mode. 
<Mega> Right. Pressing down on the +Control Pad switches you into lock-on mode. 
This will make arrows appear and point in three directions. 
<Mega> If you see the arrows, then you are in lock-on mode. So... 
While in lock-on mode, a round sight will appear on 
any enemies directly or diagonally in front of you. 
<Mega> That's called a lock-on sight. Try using a sword once a lock-on sight appears. 
We'll rush right up to the enemy and attack it thanks to my awesome speed! 
First, press down on the +Control Pad, then when a 
round sight appears, press the A Button! 
<Megaman> Got it!
