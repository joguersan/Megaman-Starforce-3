<Mega>
Up next, I'll explain about
Countering and Bonus Cards.
<PUSH>
If you land a card attack
on an enemy just as they're
<PUSH>
about to attack, that's a
Counter.
<PUSH>
That'll catch them off-guard,
paralyzing them for a time.
<PUSH>
You'll also receive a Bonus
Card for doing so.
<PUSH>
Usually, you can only use
cards you select on the
Custom Screen. But if you
<PUSH>
land a Counter, then you'll
be rewarded a Bonus Card.
<PUSH>
Bonus Cards are chosen
from your Card Folder
at random.
<PUSH>
Even so, they're great
because you don't have to
wait for the Custom Gauge
<PUSH>
to fill up before going buck
wild on the enemy!
<PUSH>
But, you can't get another
Bonus Card if you pull off a
Counter with a Bonus Card.
<PUSH>
Countering is pretty hard to
pull off, so you should work
on your timing for a bit.
<PUSH>
Try to use a Bonus Card to
delete all the enemies in
one turn!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I want to say "understood",
but it's been a while
since I last battled...
<PUSH>
It might take a little bit for
it all to come back to me.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Why does it feel like I've
heard that before...?
<PUSH>
Oh well! Just this once I'll
help you with the timing, but
just this once, you hear!?
<PUSH>
I can't focus on the battle
if I'm trying to tell you what
to do all the time!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Thanks, Mega!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, this is how I'll help you
with the Counter timing...
<PUSH>
I'll stick an arrow on top of
the head of enemies that
can be Countered.
<PUSH>
You'll achieve a Counter if
you hit the enemy while the
arrow is still over its head.
<PUSH>
There are Battle Cards that
hit the enemy right away...
<PUSH>
But there are also ones
that take more time to hit
enemies.
<PUSH>
So, do your best to make
Battle Cards hit the enemy
<PUSH>
while the arrow is still over
its head.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Got it!
I'm ready to try it out now!
<PUSH>
