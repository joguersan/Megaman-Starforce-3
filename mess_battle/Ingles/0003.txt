This is the Custom Screen.
<PUSH>
Six cards are randomly
selected from the 30 cards
<PUSH>
that are in your Folder, and
then displayed here.
<PUSH>
Then you select cards to
use from those six.
<PUSH>
Using a card won't make it
disappear forever, so don't
be scared to use them!
<PUSH>
However, you can't just
use all of the cards on
the Custom Screen.
<PUSH>
There are rules that decide
which cards you can use in
combination.
<PUSH>
Rule #1!
Cards in the same column
can be selected together.

Rule #2!
Three cards in the same
row can be picked together.

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
White cards are very useful.
They can be paired with
any card on the screen.
<PUSH>
None of the previous three
rules apply to them.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Got it!
But what if I don't
know what a card does?
<PUSH>
There's a description, right?
How do I access it?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
You can use the R Button
or Y Button to see card
descriptions.
<PUSH>
OK! I think that about sums
up the Custom Screen.

Try to select more than two
cards, OK!?
<PUSH>
You can select them by
touching them, as well.

The A Button for Battle
Cards, and the B Button for
the Mega Buster... Got it!
<PUSH>
And that's my HP up in the
