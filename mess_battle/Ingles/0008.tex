<Woody> I would like to teach you about Support Use. Please look at the bottom screen. 
<Woody> On the Custom Screen, there are dark cards under certain cards, right? 
<Woody> If you touch them, you will be able to use them as Support Use Cards. 
Single Use is also selectable. That means the card can be used as normal. But you 
can't pick any other cards if you choose Single Use. 
Back to Support Use... Each element activates a different Support Use ability: 
Non-elemental = AreaEater Fire Element = Attack+10 Aqua Element = Invisible 
Elec Element = ParlyzPlus Wood Element = GrassStage 
Right now, we are going to use the Non-elemental card 
Cannon. So the Support Use will be AreaEater! 
AreaEater erases the 
front row, pulling the enemies closer to you. 
First, touch Cannon and select Support Use. Then 
pick BeastSlap1, followed by the OK Button. 
<Woody> It looks like you're ready. So let's test it out! 
First, erase the front row by using AreaEater. 
Follow that with BeastSlap1 to get a Double Deletion! 
<Woody> Press the OK Button once you have picked your cards. 
<Woody> Pick that card after you select an attack card. 
<Woody> First, touch Cannon, then pick Support Use. 
<Woody> Could you please pick Support Use this time? 
<Woody> You haven't selected BeastSlap1 yet. 
<Woody> Running is not an option.
