<Megaman>
The Wave Road is frozen?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Must be a problem with
the EM wave temperature...
Ice sure is a pain.
<PUSH>
Listen up, kid.
<PUSH>
The temperature of our
body will decrease as
we're on the frozen floor.
<PUSH>
Once our body temperature
reaches the lower limit...
<PUSH>
We will freeze up and could
be stuck here forever.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
What about Battle Cards?
Can we melt the ice with
Fire Elemental Cards?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
No, that won't work.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Well there goes that idea...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
However, if we stand on
a normal floor, our
temperature will rise.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
So that means... We have
to get off the ice floor
before we freeze up.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Sounds like you got it, kid.
Don't forget to check the
thermometer I'm setting up.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Thanks, Mega.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
...All that being said, there's
still a big risk to this.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
True, but I have no other
choice. I promise we won't
get frozen.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Taurus>
Hey, Mega Man.
Looks like it's my turn
again, eh?
<PUSH>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 3]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Taurus!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Taurus>
Just in case, I've opened
a line between us.
<PUSH>
If your body temperature
hits 0 and you freeze,
touch my pop-up!
<PUSH>
If you do that, I'll warm
you back up with my
Taurus Flame.
<PUSH>
But I can't stay very long
in such low temperatures.
<PUSH>
Ten seconds is about all
I can last.
<PUSH>
And my Taurus Flame is
hard to use in the cold.
<PUSH>
So I need you to press
the A Button repeatedly
for the whole ten seconds.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
What if I mess up?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Taurus>
I'll be able to break the
ice and get you moving
again, but...
<PUSH>
I won't be able to fully
restore your body
temperature.
<PUSH>
That's why you have to
do your best to help me
for the whole ten seconds.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Got it!
I'm counting on you if I
get frozen.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Taurus>
Ha. I'm sure you'll be just
fine. Don't worry about it.
<PUSH>
But if there are any ice
walls blocking the way,
<PUSH>
call on me and I'll take
care of them for you.
<PUSH>
Go take care of business!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Thanks, Taurus!
<PUSH>
Let's do this, Mega!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
OK!
<PUSH>
