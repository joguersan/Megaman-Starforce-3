<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Thanks a lot, Geo.
<PUSH>
And I'm sorry for all the
trouble.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

Don't worry about it.
It's what friends are for.

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
So this is the Roof of
the school, huh?
<PUSH>
It's really nice up here
with the breeze and the
view.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
It's the most popular place
at Echo Ridge Elementary.
<PUSH>
Give me a second to call
Prez and the others.

I'm so glad to see
you again, Sonia!

I watch your TV show,

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Thanks, guys!

[SENTENCE NUMBER 4]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
So what happened that
forced you to take shelter
on the Roof?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Well, I was looking for
Jack, but I couldn't find
him.
<PUSH>
Then I bumped into Sonia.
<PUSH>
After we talked for a bit,
a fan noticed her.
<PUSH>
So we had to EM Wave
Change and use the Wave
Road to get away.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Oh yeah, Sonia can EM
Wave Change just like Geo.
<PUSH>
You become Harp Note,
right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
I'm so jealous!
I wish I could EM Wave
Change with Pedia!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Pedia>
Sorry, Zack.
I am not equipped with
that function.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
So why did you come to
Echo Ridge, today, Sonia?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Oh, well, I really wanted to
see everyone since it's
been awhile.
<PUSH>
I also wanted to ask if
everyone wanted to appear
in my TV show tomorrow.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 5]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Be on TV!?
Us!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Well, only as extras.
As long as it's cool with
everyone...
<PUSH>
But don't worry! I'm going
to make sure the director
gets you clearly on screen.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
A chance to appear on a
TV show...
It's a dream come true...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
They got free catering at
TV recordings! Booyah! I'm
totally in!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

<Zack>
Is that all you really care
about, Bud?
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 7]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
So it's decided then...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Of course!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Since she went to all the
trouble to invite us...
<PUSH>
We should go to make her
happy, right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Yey!
<PUSH>
Oh yeah! I'm also doing a
concert at the studio,
after the recording!
<PUSH>
You're welcome to come to
that as well!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Sweet! I haven't heard you
live in a while.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Yeah, I've been busy with
other things. But singing is
my true passion!
<PUSH>
I'm really excited to get
up on stage again!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Where exactly is the TV
show recording and the
concert taking place?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
At <Studi.WBG>!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Ah, I know that studio!
<PUSH>
It's a new studio where
humans and Wizards work
<PUSH>
together to make TV
shows!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
That's right!
Even the director of my
show is a Wizard.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
So cool...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
So is it really OK?
I mean, the studio is
kind of far away.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Not a problem!
For you we'd do just
about anything!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Would you go that far for
me, Bud?
<PUSH>
Maybe if you got a pizza
as a reward or something...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 8]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Of course I would!
Even with no pizza!

<Sonia>
...Ah.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
What's up?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
I just received a pop-up.
<PUSH>
I have to get back for a
meeting about the TV show
and concert. Gotta run!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
What!?
But you just got here!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Yeah, I know...
<PUSH>
Should I pretend I didn't
see it?
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 10]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I don't think that's a good
idea, Sonia!
<PUSH>
The TV show recording and
the concert are tomorrow,
right?
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 11]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>

I could never skip out on
my work and my passion!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 12]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>

But I did really want to
hang out with everyone.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Don't worry. We'll all see
each other tomorrow!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
I guess you're right.
Then I'll see you all
tomorrow at <Studi.WBG>!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
I can't wait!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Take it easy!

Ah, Sonia!
You shouldn't go that way!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 14]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Why not?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
The entire school would
get thrown into a panic.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Ah, good point.
I'll EM Wave Change and
go back that way, then.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 15]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
She seems to forget just
how big of a star she
actually is...
<PUSH>
I suppose that's not a
bad trait to have.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 16]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
So how are we going to
get to <Studi.WBG>?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Let's meet at the Wave
Liner Wicket like we did when
we went to <Spica.Mall>.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
We're going to appear in a
TV show and get to see
a concert! How awesome!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Really? What is it?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Hehehe.
You'll find out tomorrow!
<PUSH>
And don't you dare be
late, Bud!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Understood!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Then that's all for today!
