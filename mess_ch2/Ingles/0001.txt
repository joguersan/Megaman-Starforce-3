<NEW-DIALOG>
4The shooting star known
as "Meteor G"...
<PUSH>
So its speed has
increased...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
3Yes, sir.
It has also changed its
course for Earth.
<PUSH>
There is now a 67%
probability it will hit.

<NEW-DIALOG>
{98}{00}Chief, regarding the out of
control Wizard incident at
<Echo.Ridge> yesterday...
<PUSH>
It seems that "Crimson"
was spotted sometime
during the incident.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4Interesting...
<PUSH>
Was any of it confiscated?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{98}{00}Nothing was left by the
time the Satella Police
arrived on the scene.
<PUSH>
It appears someone may
have taken it...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4Every time there is an
EM wave related incident
where Crimson is spotted,
<PUSH>
the probability that Meteor
G will strike Earth rises...
<PUSH>
Certainly, Meteor G is not
just an ordinary shooting
star, but...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
3Unfortunately, we still do
not know what it is made
of...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{98}{00}For the time being, any
Crimson appearing should
be a cause for alarm!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}Just calm down.
<PUSH>
Right now...
<PUSH>
Netopia HQ is leading
several other HQs on a
mission to alter its course.
<PUSH>
If they are successful...

<NEW-DIALOG>
2Chief, we have a problem!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4What is it?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
2Netopia HQ, Sharo HQ,
NetFrica HQ, and all other
<PUSH>
main WAZA HQs have been
destroyed!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4You must be joking!!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
3All the HQs that were
working on changing the
course of Meteor G...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
2It appears that missiles
were fired at Meteor G
to alter its course.
<PUSH>
However, they missed and
then a large amount of
Noise poured out of
<PUSH>
Meteor G, destroying their
countries' networks
and computer systems!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{98}{00}So that means that they
are no longer able to assist
us with Meteor G...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
3I-I can't...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4What about Electopia?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
2We were just barely able
to cut our systems' links
to the other countries.
<PUSH>
We suffered no damage.
<PUSH>
{13}{E2}{01}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
4So we were lucky that we
were on the back side of
the planet at the time...
<PUSH>
However, we thus inherited
the most important mission
of all...
