Jack...
You can't go off and do
what you want like that...

Our mission is to find out

classmates and making
Wizards go out of control...

<Jack>
But, Sis...
It's just not me.

I can't handle trivial stuff,
like investigations and
associating with those kids.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
You don't see me doing
whatever I want to do...
<PUSH>
I have to spend the whole
day with those lower class
buffoons they call teachers.
<PUSH>
So I'm sick of the whole
thing already, too.
<PUSH>
But we have to follow
Mr. King's orders.

At the moment, fighting is
not our duty...

Our duty is to follow

fullest.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
To make Wizards go out
of control and record Mega
Man's battle data.
<PUSH>
And to collect the Crimson
that is created during the
process.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

That's right...

Quite an easy task for
us, right?

Don't let Geo Stelar out

Yeah, I know.
