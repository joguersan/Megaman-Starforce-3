Hey, Lee.
Sure, what's up?

Now that you mention it...
<PUSH>
It does feel strangely cold
around here.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
I was too excited about
the concert to notice,
but now I feel it, too...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Really?
I don't feel anything.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Taurus>
That's 'cause you've got
all that extra insulation
on you!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
That makes sense!
I'm glad to have it!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

The Cyber Core is frozen!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Yeah...
It shouldn't be possible for
a Cyber Core of a Real

Wave that's this big to
ever freeze up.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

This doesn't feel good at
all, kid...

{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Our worst fear is that...
<PUSH>
...the projector will
stop responding.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
That means...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Everyone on the stage will
be stuck up there without
any way to get down.
<PUSH>
And if it gets too cold,
they could all freeze to
death...

<Prez>
T-That's terrible...

Hi, Belle.
How are you doing?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Belle>
Well...
My Wizard, Ice, disappeared
a little while ago.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Ice...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
That popsicle-looking one,
right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Belle>
I heard from the staff
about the threats and the
other problems.
<PUSH>
They seem to have begun
right after she disappeared.
<PUSH>
Her rivalry with Sonia is
making me a little worried
that maybe Ice...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
There's no way it's her.
<PUSH>
Ice is your Manager Wizard.
<PUSH>
She couldn't possibly have
that kind of power.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Belle>
That's true, but...

<PUSH>
Sure, I'll give you access,
but I'm not asking why you
need it...
<PUSH>
Because you're not only
my Team member, but also
my Brother.
<PUSH>
The only reason the
concert was able to even
start was you.
<PUSH>
I know you can fix this
and save everyone, too.
