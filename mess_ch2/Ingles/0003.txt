[SENTENCE NUMBER 1]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Huh?
What's going on?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Ah, good morning, Geo.
<PUSH>
As you can see, the
school gate is locked and
we can't get in.
<PUSH>
The Wizard that guards the
school gate said that he
won't open it without
<PUSH>
permission from the teacher
in charge of the gate.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{92}{00}Can't do what I can't do!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Where's the teacher that's
in charge?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Apparently, he's not here.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Hey, you!
What's wrong with opening
the gate for the kids!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{92}{00}Oh, great. Another noisy
young brat. Rules are rules!
<PUSH>
If you really want me to
open it, then bring it on,
you big blue ball of fuzz!
<PUSH>
{A0}{E1}{04}{00}<
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Why you...
I'll tear you to pieces!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Cut it out, Mega...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
He's always starting some
kind of trouble, isn't he?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
The Wizard is just doing
his job. There's not much
that we can do, other
<PUSH>
than find out where the
teacher in charge is and
have him open it for us.
<PUSH>
Even Pedia doesn't have
any other suggestions.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Pedia>
There's nothing else!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Well then, I guess I'll go
home and have my second
breakfast of the day!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Isn't the teacher in charge
of the school gate that
scary teacher from before?
<PUSH>
It seems strange that he
would be late...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
That's true...
He doesn't seem like a
teacher who would be tardy.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I'll go to his home and
check on him.
Maybe something happened.
<PUSH>
Where exactly does he live,
by the way?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
He lives in Room 202 of
the same apartment building
that I live in.
<PUSH>
If you stand in front of
the building, a pop-up will
appear.
<PUSH>
Touch the pop-up for his
room to call the teacher.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Great! Let's go, Mega!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>
