<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ice>
For you, Belle...
<PUSH>
With Sonia out of the way,
you could soar right to
the top...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Belle>
I never asked for that!!
<PUSH>
Do you think someone who
would hurt others could
become popular and loved!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ice>
You're too nice!
So you don't understand!
<PUSH>
No one ever makes it in
the talent industry without
a little dirty work.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Belle>
That's not true!
<PUSH>
It's you who doesn't
understand!
<PUSH>
So are you telling me that
Sonia stepped all over
<PUSH>
people to get to where
she is now!?

T-That...!!

Sonia has never done
anything of the sort!

She just tries her hardest
to make people happy!

And because of that, she
is highly admired and has
a ton of fans!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ice>
Belle...
I'm so sorry...
<PUSH>
I lost myself along the
way, somehow.
<PUSH>
I'm not fit to be your
manager, anymore.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Belle>
That's not true...
<PUSH>
There's no one else in the
world that cares for me
as much as you do.
<PUSH>
Ice...
<PUSH>
I'll only make you worry
non-stop, but would you
continue as my manager?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ice>
Belle...!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Belle>
No one else could ever be
my manager...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ice>
I'm so sorry, Belle...
And thank you...
<PUSH>
I'm so proud to be your
Wizard.
<PUSH>

Looks like that's settled.
<PUSH>
I was worried there for a
second.
