Cool. This is where the
Real Wave stage is going
to be set up.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Pedia>
According to my information
banks, the stage has been
designed around Sonia.

Therefore, the main color
will be light pink.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Vogue>
Sounds cute!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Very interesting, indeed.

<Geo>
How are you feeling, Sonia?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Not bad, not bad.
<PUSH>
I'm just a little bit
nervous...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
I didn't think pros like you
actually got nervous.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
We definitely do...
<PUSH>
Either way, I'm going to
have a fun time and give
the best concert I can!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
You'll be great!
<PUSH>
We're all going to root you
on from the audience!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
You're the best, Sonia!
You'll do just fine!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
And even if you make a
little mistake, just shrug it
off and enjoy the moment!
<PUSH>
That's how I try to live
my life, everyday!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
That's because you're
always making mistakes...
<PUSH>
Sonia is too much of a
pro for that.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
Thank you, everyone...

Hey, it's Lee.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>

<Geo>
What's wrong?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Everything...
<PUSH>
Someone sent a virus to
my <Hunter>.

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
A threatening message!?
<PUSH>
What does it say!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
"I will ruin Sonia Strumm's
Concert."
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Sonia's concert...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Since the message was
sent directly to my <Hunter>,
the sender must have a
<PUSH>
connection with the studio
somehow.
<PUSH>
I have no idea what they
are planning, but it doesn't
sound good at all.
<PUSH>
But still, we "SoniaBackers"
will do our best to make it
a "Successful Concert"...!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
"SoniaBackers"?

<Geo>
That's the name of Lee's
Team.

Their Purpose is to
make Sonia's concert a
"Successful Concert".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

Actually, we just updated
our Purpose a few minutes
ago.

[SENTENCE NUMBER 9]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
You updated it?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Yeah, the new Purpose of
"SoniaBackers" is to
"Save the Concert".
<PUSH>
We don't know who would
want to ruin the concert,
<PUSH>
but we won't let them get
away with a single thing!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Lee!
Please let me help out,
too!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Geo...
I really appreciate it, but
this could turn dangerous.
<PUSH>
If a virus was able to
access the Event Stage,
<PUSH>
the whole audience would
be in grave danger.
<PUSH>
If you were mixed up in
the situation, who knows
what could happen to you.
<PUSH>
Sonia couldn't handle that,
could she?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
But...
<PUSH>
{13}{E2}{01}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
...Lee.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Yeah?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Sonia was Geo's first
Brother. And they're
best friends.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Yeah, I know that.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Despite his appearance,
Geo has actually solved
<PUSH>
many problems caused by
viruses, for many people.
<PUSH>
Sonia and everyone else
here have been saved by
Geo multiple times.

[SENTENCE NUMBER 11]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Is that OK with you!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
That means Geo will have
to leave "Luna 4 Prez"!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Idiot! Don't you think I
know that!?
<PUSH>
But this goes beyond just
the concert! Sonia's life
could be in danger!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Yeah...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
She has a point...
<PUSH>
This person is bad enough
to send viruses and even
threatening messages!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
If this person is actually
serious, then this could
turn into something big.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Exactly.
<PUSH>
Once the concert is a
success, then Geo can
return to "Luna 4 Prez".
<PUSH>
Right now, you need to
protect Sonia, Geo...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Well then...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 12]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
If it's true that Geo has
actually solved other virus
related problems, then I
<PUSH>
can't afford to let such a
valuable person not join.
<PUSH>
And in fact, whoever this
person is, he has already
<PUSH>
started to cause problems
all over the studio.
<PUSH>
I need all the help I can
get. So, please join my
Team, Geo.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Thank you...
<PUSH>
You can count on me, Lee!
