<Mega>
Like I said. Until the other
day, I hadn't gone buck
wild in a long time.
<PUSH>
So I'm training for the
next trouble that pops up!
<PUSH>
I want to make sure I'm
ready to rock!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Cool...
<PUSH>
Ah! More importantly, I
need to check the TV!

"More importantly"!?
What show could be that
important!?

[SENTENCE NUMBER 4]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Magnes went out of
control recently, right?
<PUSH>
And before that, a Wizard
went out of control at
<Spica.Mall>...
<PUSH>
I've been really interested
in why this is happening to
Wizards, lately...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
And you think that idiot box
will tell you all that!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I'm not really sure, but...
I heard there's going to
be a special on Wizards.
<PUSH>
I figured it would be worth
it to check it out.

*Welcome to our special on
Wizards and "Noise".
<PUSH>
Tonight, we will be talking
to EM technology expert,
Legendary Master Shin.
<PUSH>
Thank you for coming,
Legendary Master Shin.
<PUSH>
{12}{E2}<Mr.King-2>
{00}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
$It's legendary!
Thanks for having me!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
*So you are very familiar
with Noise, aren't you?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
$Well, I find Noise quite
interesting, and have been
doing tons of research on it.
<PUSH>
You could almost call me
a Noise maniac!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
*I see.
What can you tell us about
Wizards and "Noise"?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
$Well, let me break it down
for you!
<PUSH>
To put it simply, "Noise" is
outputted by the world's
<PUSH>
EM technology. Almost like
the exhaust of a car.
<PUSH>
It is the negative to all
the positives we receive
from EM technology.
<PUSH>
Actually, it is the largest
and most severe problem
<PUSH>
humanity has ever had to
deal with.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
*Wow, that was a mouthful!
<PUSH>
I'm not sure I understood
any of that...
<PUSH>
{13}{E2}{01}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
$Oh, really? Hmm, well...
<PUSH>
OK, I'll break it down for
you.
<PUSH>

$"Noise" is constantly being
emitted from all sorts of
devices, like <Hunter>s.
<PUSH>
It is what attracts viruses
and causes all sorts of
problems with Cyber Cores.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
*I see. So... 
<PUSH>
"Noise" is always around
us making devices not
work properly.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
$You got it!
<PUSH>
However, with the new
kind of Wizards that have
been released lately...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 8]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
$In short, it was discovered
that the new Wizards are
<PUSH>
emitting much more Noise
than all other types of
EM technologies.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Wizards are emitting Noise...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
That's the price humans have
to pay for a comfortable
lifestyle, eh?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
$And if a Wizard goes out
of control...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 9]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
$A considerable amount of
Noise is emitted...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 10]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
$When enough is created,
the Noise will form into
large clusters.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
*Noise clusters...
So they crystallize?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
$That's right.
<PUSH>
A large amount of Noise
will become a red crystal.
<PUSH>
These crystals are called
"Crimson".
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 11]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
$It is still unknown what
kind of problems Crimson
can cause...
<PUSH>
But Crimson should be a
big concern for the human
race in general.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>
{13}{E2}{02}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
$Indeed, Wizards are a
wonderful creation provided
by today's technology.
<PUSH>
However, the fact that
they are producing the
<PUSH>
Crimson at high levels is
well documented.
<PUSH>
Humanity must deal with
this problem as quickly and
adequately as possible.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
*That was the Legendary
Master Shin and his
explanation of Noise.
<PUSH>
Thank you so much.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
$No worries!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
*Next up...
<PUSH>
A delightful and warming
report on a new
amusement park built
<PUSH>
for children by the "King
Foundation".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Crimson, huh?
I didn't notice any when
Magnes was out of control.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
We didn't really learn why
Wizards are going out of
control, did we?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Hope(Mom)>
Geeeooo?
You'll be late for school!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Oh, man!
I gotta run!
