<Megaman> The entrance to the Noise Wave is blocking the Wave Road... 
What should we do? 
<Rogue> ... 
You're in my way. Move. 
<Megaman> S-Sure... 
<Megaman> Rogue... What are you going to do? 
<Rogue> ... 
Hmph. 
<Megaman> Rogue!! 
You don't know what could happen in that Noise Wave! 
Acid even said so! 
Even you will be in danger if you go in there! 
<Mega> *sigh* Geez, this guy is really starting to annoy me! 
<Megaman> We're going, Mega! 
<Mega> OK!
