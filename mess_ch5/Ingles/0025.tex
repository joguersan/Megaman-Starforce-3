<Rogue> ...Hmph. I've changed my mind. 
I think he will listen to you... 
...And then you'll become close friends... 
<Rogue> But one day, he will turn on you, and you will regret everything... 
<Megaman> Rogue... 
<Mega> Hey, kid! There's no time for this mushy stuff!

<Megaman> !! 
<Megaman> Oh yeah! We've got to get to the roof!
