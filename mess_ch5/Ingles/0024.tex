Are you really ready for this? 
<Megaman> Ready? 
<Mega> Ready to kick Jack's butt! 
If you're really going out there, then you have to be fully prepared to fight. 
You won't stand a chance if your mind isn't 100% into this fight. 
<Megaman> ...I guess you're right... 
But, I still want to talk to Jack and give him a chance to stop, first... 
If I can just get him to listen to me, I know he'll... 
<Rogue> ...Hmph! 
What do you think you could say to convince him? 
<Rogue> You're so naive it makes me sick! 
It will be me who will take him down. 
But before that{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} You're going down, first! 
<Megaman> What are you talking about!? This is not the time for...!! 
<Rogue> You really are naive!! 
<Mega> Wake up, kid!! 
Here he comes! 
<Megaman> ...!!
