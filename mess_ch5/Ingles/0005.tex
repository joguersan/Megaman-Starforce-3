<Megaman> Ace, Acid, what are you guys doing!? 
<Acid.Ace> {13}{EC}... 
<Acid> {13}{EC}... 
<Mega> Are you still members of Dealer...!? 
<Acid.Ace> {13}{EC}... 
Bingo! 
<Megaman> ...What!? 
<Acid.Ace> Well, not really. Until now there wasn't any reason to test you. 
I had been putting it off for some time... 
But I thought it was the right time to have a real 
battle, so that I could fully grasp your true potential. 
<Mega> So you decided to sneak attack us? 
<Acid.Ace> Hahaha! It's all about the atmosphere! 
You were freaking out, right? 
You were like "No way!", right? 
<Mega> Not...{16}{E1} Not at all. Not even a drop of sweat! 
You think you surprised us!? 
<Megaman> U-Umm, well then... 
So what was the test really for? It couldn't have been just to test my power... 
<Acid.Ace> Well, you see... 
<HarpNote> Geeeo! 
<Taurus.Fire> Hey, Geo! 
<Megaman> Huh!? 
<Megaman> Sonia...{15}{E1} and Bud!? 
Why are you two here!? 
<Acid.Ace> Let me re-introduce you all. 
<Acid.Ace> ...This is Mega Man. 
He's going to fight along with you, as the newest 
member of the Satella Police Commandos!
