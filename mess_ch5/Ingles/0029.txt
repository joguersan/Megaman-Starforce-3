<Megaman>
I can't find the exit for this
Noise Wave!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
On top of that, I'm sensing
something really suspicious...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
...!!

<Megaman>
W-What's wrong, Rogue?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Here it comes.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Huh!?

[SENTENCE NUMBER 4]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Is that a virus!?
<PUSH>
No, it can't be...
It's got to be Noise!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
That's what it looks like!
It's completely made up of
Noise!
<PUSH>
It's like a Noise cluster that
can move around!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Hmph...
Dealer is into some elaborate
stuff, it seems.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
!?
<PUSH>
So that means...
<PUSH>
That both this Noise Wave
and that Noise monster are
Jack's doing.
<PUSH>
It must be a Dealer weapon!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Exactly.
<PUSH>
I'm going to delete this thing.
{15}{E1}...Give me a hand.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Huh!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
That thing is in control of
this area.
<PUSH>
If we delete it, we will be
able to pulse out, and this
Noise Wave will be destroyed.
<PUSH>
It's pretty simple.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
How the heck do you know
this, anyway!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Hmph.
<PUSH>
I ran into one of these
things before you caught up
with me.
<PUSH>
It was actually pretty tough.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
So listen up.
<PUSH>
It attacks by firing out
Noise.
<PUSH>
If you leave the Noise alone,
it will explode and hurt you.
<PUSH>
The explosion causes a
considerable shock wave.
<PUSH>
My EM shield didn't really
have much of an effect, so...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
So use your Buster to
destroy all the Noise that
<PUSH>
it fires out, before it
explodes!
<PUSH>
I will time my attacks to its
body with your attacks on
the Noise.
<PUSH>
Got it?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
OK, let's do this!
<PUSH>
