Hey, King!

What the heck are you
up to!?

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Why, whatever do you mean,
my dear Jack?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Don't play dumb with me!
<PUSH>
When are you going to save
Sis!?
<PUSH>
And you better not say you
don't have anything planned!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Now now, try not to get all
flustered, Jack...
<PUSH>
I am currently considering
what to do about your
sister...!
<PUSH>
After all, she is my precious
daughter{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}
<PUSH>
I would be a horrible father
if I didn't rescue her!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
So then...
<PUSH>
{A0}{E1}{03}{00}<(Queen)Tia>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
However!! I have determined
that this is not the proper
time to do so, Jack...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
W-What...!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
While we have struck WAZA
a devastating blow...
<PUSH>
And it appears that the
world is already in our hands,
<PUSH>
we have not scored a
checkmate just yet.
<PUSH>
There's still Mega Man and
Eos...{15}{E1}
<PUSH>
And a few other annoying
little insects to deal with.
<PUSH>
The tide will turn even
more in our favor if our
next move is the right one.
<PUSH>
Maybe you should think about
it like a strategy you use in
a video game...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
...Argh!
<PUSH>
Then hurry up and give me
my next orders!
<PUSH>
I'll take down every last one
of them!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Oh, Jack...
<PUSH>
I am sorry to let you down,
but this time I think I will
have Joker go for me.
<PUSH>
You have just been too
hot-headed, as of late.
<PUSH>
If this move is not perfectly
followed through, then Queen
<PUSH>
Tia could fall into great
danger.
<PUSH>
I hope you understand what
I am saying, my dear son!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
...!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Heartless...
<PUSH>
How are the preparations
going?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
Sir...
<PUSH>
The Noise creation program
will be completed very soon.
<PUSH>
But the tuning of the Noise
Level controller is taking
some time.
<PUSH>
The Noise to Real Wave
process is not going very
smoothly.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Hmm...
<PUSH>
So the program has proven
too much for those
simpletons to handle, has it?
<PUSH>
Ho ho ho ho!
<PUSH>
That is fine.{15}{E1}
I will complete the program...!
<PUSH>
With these very hands!
<PUSH>
Ho ho ho ho ho ho!!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
That jerk...
<PUSH>
There's no way that he is
really worried about Sis!
<PUSH>
I bet that he isn't planning
on saving her at all!!
<PUSH>
So that means...
<PUSH>
I'll just have to do it all by
myself!!
<PUSH>
I'm going to save you, Sis!!
<PUSH>
...Just hang in there a little
while longer for me.
<PUSH>
First, I have a score to
settle...
<PUSH>
Mega Man will pay for what
he did to you!!
<PUSH>
