<Hope(Mom)> ...Geo! 
Wake up, Geo! 
<Geo> *groggy* 
I can't eat anymore. *mumble, mumble* 
<Hope(Mom)> Geo! 
<Hope(Mom)> It's time to wake up! 
<Geo> *yawn*{15}{E1} What...!? 
<Geo-2> Oh no! I have to get to school! 
Today is the election for student body president...! 
<Mega> Prez was here earlier to pick you up. 
But you wouldn't wake up, so she went without you. 
Geez, kid... She's not going to be happy! 
<Geo-2> Oh boy... 
Either way, we have to get to school!! 
<Game> Geo's Team and Purpose have changed!
