4I know that Ace has already
spoken to you of this, but...
<PUSH>
I too, would like to request
your assistance, on behalf
of all of WAZA.
<PUSH>
There is no doubt that
without your help, WAZA
would have been destroyed.
<PUSH>
Yet, we suffered substantial
losses.
<PUSH>
And we are now incapable
of performing a number of
our standard functions.
<PUSH>
We have managed to maintain
enough forces to fight, but
<PUSH>
if another event such as
the recent attack from
Dealer were to occur...
<PUSH>
Thus, we have no other
choice but to rely on you
<PUSH>
three and your ability to
EM Wave Change!
<PUSH>
That is why we have asked
you to join the Satella Police
<PUSH>
Commandos, as special
members.
<PUSH>
It is vital that we can rely
on you, so that we can
stay in the fight.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

You can count on me!
<PUSH>
I'm willing to do anything I
can to help!
<PUSH>

And for Ms. Tia and Jack!

If Dealer is left to do as it
pleases, then countless more
people will suffer...

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>

<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Dealer must be stopped!

And if I can be a part of
that, then I'm ready to fight!

your safety in this fight...

Your very lives...{15}{E1} could
be in jeopardy.

We are prepared for that!

...And,{15}{E1} I'm not just saying
this lightly. I've thought long

I want to fight!

For all the people that listen
to my music...

For this world that has
given me the chance to sing
<PUSH>
my songs and have such a
wonderful life!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Oh, Ace.
Don't be so grandiose.
<PUSH>
That is the worst case
scenario.
<PUSH>
Recently, we have come
upon some new data about
Meteor G.
<PUSH>
...In fact, it was Aaron that
acquired the data. I'm so
proud of that child.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
You mean Mr. Boreal?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
That's right, Geo.
<PUSH>
Aaron is here at WAZA,
helping us research not only
<PUSH>
Noise, but also Crimson and
Meteor G.
<PUSH>
And faster than Bud couild
eat an apple pie, he stumbled
upon a great discovery.
<PUSH>
He has discovered that
Meteor G is actually a giant
Noise cluster!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
!!
<PUSH>
An asteroid...
<PUSH>
That's completely made of
Noise!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
That's what the data is
telling us.
<PUSH>
It's an absolutely gigantic
collection of Noise bound
together.
<PUSH>
It is possible that EM Waves
that travel to space are all
gathering at the same spot...
<PUSH>
Thus, creating Noise, and
ultimately Meteor G.
<PUSH>
On top of that, it is being
pulled by the Crimson that
has collected on the Earth.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Meteor G is being pulled!?
<PUSH>
N-No way...{15}{E1}
If the Earth was destroyed...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
What do you mean by "if"!?

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Well, um...
<PUSH>
What if Meteor G were to
hit the planet...!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Exactly.{15}{E1} That is the worst
case scenario.
<PUSH>
The impact of Meteor G
hitting the Earth would cause
it to break up...
<PUSH>
And the highly concentrated
Noise would spread, knocking
<PUSH>
out every piece of EM
technology.
<PUSH>
Therefore, our society that
we have built upon EM
technology would collapse...
<PUSH>
We have relied on EM
technology for so long, that
I fear that humans would
<PUSH>
lack hope for the future and
turn on each other out of
confusion and anger.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
See? I told you.
<PUSH>
You were better off not
knowing!
<PUSH>
Well...

Like Doc said, the planet
being destroyed is the worst
case scenario.
<PUSH>
But WAZA is sure to come
up with something.

we can to help.
