<Geo> ...What!? 
<Geo> Sonia!? 
Why is Sonia at school...!? 
<Bud> Oh, you're here, Geo! 
<Zack> G-Geo! 
<Sonia> Geo... 
I came to support Luna... 
But we have a bigger problem than the election... 
<Geo-2> What do you mean!? 
<Geo-2> S-Solo...!? 
<Solo> {13}{EC}... 
<Geo-2> Umm... 
So that means... That Jack is coming here!? 
<Solo> ...Hmph. 
It makes sense that he would attack where all of 
you are assembled in the same place. 
Three birds with one stone. 
<Geo-2> So then... 
You're just going to wait in this class room until he shows up...!? 
<Solo> {13}{EC}... 
...Of course. 
<Geo-2> !! 
Th-That's no good...! 
If something like yesterday happened here...! 
<Solo> ...If you guys want to cause a scene, then go for it. 
But leave me out of it. 
<Geo-2> B-But... 
We can't let the teachers and students get caught up in this....! 
At the very least, we should go somewhere else... 
<Solo> ...! 
Hmph... He's finally here. 
<Geo-2> What!?
