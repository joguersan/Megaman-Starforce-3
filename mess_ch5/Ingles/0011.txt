Possibly!
We'll have to ask Ace or

<Acid>
There's no doubt.
<PUSH>
It's a portal to a
"Noise Wave".
<PUSH>
And it appears to be quite
large, too!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Noise Wave...
<PUSH>
{12}{E2}<(Queen)Tia>
{01}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid>
A Noise Wave is a world
that is completely made up
of Noise.
<PUSH>
It can be seen as a
dangerous Cyber Core where
<PUSH>
Noise thrashes around, like
the winds of a storm.
<PUSH>
While they are not officially
acknowledged, they have
been showing up all over the
<PUSH>
world, more and more as the
Noise Level around the world
has risen.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
You guys may have stumbled
upon one of them.
<PUSH>
You didn't know, but a Noise
Wave detection function was
<PUSH>
installed into your <Hunter>-VG
when it was upgraded.
<PUSH>
It was developed based on
the fact that Noise Waves
<PUSH>
were predicted to become
more common.
<PUSH>
There's still a lot we don't
know about them, but what
do you think, Geo?
<PUSH>
Do you think it would be
worth it to go in and take
a look?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid>
!
<PUSH>
It's too dangerous, Ace.
<PUSH>
We have no idea what is in
or what could occur in a
Noise Wave of that size.
<PUSH>
Before anything else, WAZA
should perform an investi-

<Mega>
Booooooring!!
<PUSH>
You think we're scared of a
little Noise!?
<PUSH>
We'll walk right in there and
have a look, no problem!
We can do anything!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid>
I can't allow that, Omega-Xis.
<PUSH>
I must follow protocols...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I don't remember asking you!
Come on, kid!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Wh-What!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
I appreciate it, Geo.
<PUSH>
As Omega-Xis has alluded to,
no one other than Mega Man
<PUSH>
could possibly be able to
move around freely in there.
<PUSH>
If I sent anyone else, there
would be very little hope
for their return.

<Ace>
But Geo, I know you can
handle it.

You're the world's greatest
hero, after all!

I'll check it out then, Ace!

I expect you to come back
with some interesting data.

...Be careful.

<Megaman>
Always! We'll be back!
