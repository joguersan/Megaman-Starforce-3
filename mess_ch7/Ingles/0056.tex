{15}{00}Everyone back on Earth is waiting for you to come home. 
This is no time to be taking a nap, son. 
<Mega> It looks like the whole world has set the same Purpose... 
And thanks to that there is a ton of energy being sent from the planet. 
{15}{00}It's the energy that's formed when Purposes are set. 
There's so much of it this time. I guess you could call it a Purpose Wave... 
If Mega and I combine our power, we should be able to get you back to Earth. 
<Geo-2> Wait! 
What about you and Mega!? 
<Mega> {13}{EC}...

You go back first and tell Hope{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1} I mean your mother... That I'll be home soon. 
And say hello to your friends for me. 
<Mega> Goodbye, kid... 
Our time on Earth together was short, but it was one heck of a wild ride. 
Go on, skedaddle! 
Everyone is waiting for you.

Let's call him "Geo"... 
STeehee... That sounds like a name you would come up with. 
RI want him to be full of love and strength... 
So I want to name him after this planet, which has unlimited amounts of both.
