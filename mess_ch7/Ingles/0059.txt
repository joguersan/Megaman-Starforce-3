<Mega>
Heh!!
<PUSH>
I can handle a bunch of
Crimson all by myself, no
problem!
<PUSH>
Kid! Let's do this just like
when we fought those copy
freaks at WAZA!
<PUSH>
Press the B Button to make
me tear the Crimson to
pieces!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Got it, Mega!
I know you can do it!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Just remember that if I
miss, then the Crimson will
attack you head on!
<PUSH>
The Crimson itself doesn't
have any bite in its bark,
but it will call viruses to it!
<PUSH>
So stay frosty, kid!!
<PUSH>
Oh, one last thing...
You won't have a chance to
organize your folders or
<PUSH>
save your progress when
Crimson attacks you.
<PUSH>
You'll have to select the
menu screen while you're
dodging those crazy things!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
OK! I'm ready!
