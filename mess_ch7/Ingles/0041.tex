<Queen.Virgo> I see you've defeated Jack... 
It's time then{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} For your little journey to come to an end. 
<Mega> There you are, Queen Virgo. 
<Megaman> Ms. Tia... 
<Queen.Virgo> Meteor G's central core is up ahead... 
I can't let you get to him... 
<Megaman> "Him"{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} You must mean Dad. 
<Queen.Virgo> So he really is your father after all... 
<Virgo> See! That's what I said isn't it? 
The old man and this little twerp have the same exact frequency! 
But the old man is on his way out!! 
He'll be nothing but a memory soon!! 
<Megaman> W-What do you mean!? 
<Queen.Virgo> It's like she said... 
That man is using his incredible energy to keep us from reaching the core... 
But he has been fighting with Meteor G for so long now. 
He will reach his limit very, very soon... 
And then he'll be out of the way without me even having to lift a finger.... 
<Megaman> {13}{EC}!! 
<Mega> You're full of it! 
<Queen.Virgo> Either way... 
I have no idea what would happen if you two were to meet... 
At the very least, you would continue to interfere with our plans... 
So... I must stop you right here... 
<Megaman> I can't afford to be stopped either. 
I'm going to ruin your plans!! And I'm doing it for Ace!! 
<Queen.Virgo> {13}{EC}... 
Foolish child{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1} 
You definitely have guts!! 
<Megaman> Ace, give me strength!! 
Wave Battle! Ride On!!
