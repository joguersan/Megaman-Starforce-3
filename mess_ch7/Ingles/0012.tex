<Dr.Goodall> Thank you, Mega Man. 
I stayed brave the whole time, believing that you would come to rescue me. 
<Megaman> But... Why did you stay behind even though you knew you were in danger? 
<Dr.Goodall> I had something that I absolutely HAD to finish... 
Don't worry, once we're back I'll tell everyone what it was. 
<Mega> Well then, let's pulse out yesterday! 
<Megaman> Haha, good idea. 
OK, Goodall. It's time to go. 
<Dr.Goodall> OK, you'll have to lead me to the exit. 
<Megaman> No problem! Just follow me!!
