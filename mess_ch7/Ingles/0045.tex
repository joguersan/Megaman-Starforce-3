<Mr.Boreal> Meteor G has increased Noise output levels greatly!! 
What could possibly be going on!? 
<Woody> Mr. Boreal! 
Meteor G's Noise has grown too powerful for the rocket to handle! 
All functions have ceased to work. 
<Mr.Boreal> W-What did you say...? 
<Woody> Magnes was able to pulse out in time, but the rocket 
is steadily moving away from Meteor G!! 
<Prez> W-Wait just a second! 
If the rocket moves too far away, then how will Geo be able to get home!? 
<Hope(Mom)> Geo...!! 
<Sonia> I believe in him{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1} 
He's going to destroy Meteor G and bring his father back home... 
<Bud> Yeah! 
He's gotten out of every other pinch that he's been stuck in before! 
<Zack> Geo can't lose to something like Noise or Meteor G. 
Geo never loses!! 
<Prez> You're right... You guys are right!! 
Geo won't... 
The invincible Mega Man won't lose to a measly shooting star!! 
<Heartless> Geo{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} You are our final hope{14}{E1}{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} 
<Lee.Stern> Kick some butt, Geo!! 
<Dr.Goodall> Arthur{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} 
Watch over him!
