So this is Jamming...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Such powerful Noise...
<PUSH>
Though we should be fine
here, since we are resistant
to Noise.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
That's probably why
Mr. Boreal wouldn't let Sonia
and Bud come with us.
<PUSH>
They'd be in serious danger
just by being this close.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Yeah.
So that old lady should
be in there somewhere, huh?
<PUSH>
But I don't think we can get
in there, even while EM
Wave Changed.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>

So maybe with my awesome
strength I could break up
some of the Noise.

<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
It won't work everywhere...
<PUSH>
But it just might work in
places where the Noise is
very weak!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Sounds like a plan!
You can do this, Mega!!
