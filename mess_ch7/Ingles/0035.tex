<Diamon.Ice> Mehehehehe... 
<Megaman> Diamond Ice!! 
<Mega> It's not the same Diamond Ice that you fought before! 
The Crimson that was released when she was out

It is not a difficult task to reconstruct the data! 
<Megaman> Did Jack and Ms. Tia set this up...? 
Either way, nothing is going to stop me from moving on! 
<Mega> We're off the chain! We won't even break a sweat with this one!! 
<Megaman> Let's rock, Mega! 
Wave Battle! Ride On!!
