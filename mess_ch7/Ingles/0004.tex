<Mr.King-2> I am sure you are all aware of the red shooting star in the sky, Meteor G. 
Meteor G is no ordinary shooting star. 
It is a gigantic collection of Noise. A so called "Noise cluster". 
<Lee.Stern> Noise... 
<Mr.King-2> If Meteor G were to strike the planet... 
All EM technology would be rendered completely useless. 
<Belle> N-No way... 
<Mr.King-2> However... I have come upon the means to control Meteor G! 
I alone possess the ability to stop its certain impact with Earth. 
Does everyone understand? 
The fate of the world lies in my hands!! 
<Ice> {13}{EC}...
