<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Geo, I'm so glad to see that
you are OK.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
But, Mr. Boreal...
If we can't stop Meteor G...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
I know, I know...
<PUSH>
We have absolutely no
intentions of giving up.
<PUSH>
As long as we don't give up
there is always hope.
<PUSH>
Isn't that right, Geo?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yeah!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
That's why we have decided
to form a new Team.
<PUSH>
The Team's Purpose is to
"Stop Meteor G".
<PUSH>
And we've decided to name
the Team after the great
power given to you by the
<PUSH>
Satellite Admins the first
time you protected Earth.
<PUSH>
That great power was
called...
<PUSH>
"Star Force".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Star Force...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4We would like you to take
the leader position of the
Team.
<PUSH>
We believe it is in your
power to stop Meteor G.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
But, I don't have any clue
how to do that.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Oh, I almost forgot.
<PUSH>
The explanation will go much
smoother if I introduce the
other members first.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Other members?

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Woody!?
And Lee too!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
To be honest, we both
aren't really sure why we
were selected for this.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
But just being able to check
out WAZA's facilities and
<PUSH>
meet the esteemed
Dr. Goodall has been moving!
<PUSH>
.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}Actually, why is it that you
were called here, Geo?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Well, now that all of the
Team members have been
<PUSH>
assembled, we can discuss
our mission plans.
<PUSH>
I will also explain why you
all have been selected.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 5]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
But before that, a quick
briefing on the current
situation is in order.
<PUSH>
Meteor G has been freed of
King's control, and is again
headed straight for Earth.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Really!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Magnes sent me a report on
this not too long ago.
<PUSH>
If it isn't stopped, Meteor G
will smash into the planet,
<PUSH>
destroying all EM technology
in the world.
<PUSH>
And worst of all, most of
humanity will be wiped out.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 6]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Really!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
It's exactly as he said.
<PUSH>
Star Force must stop
Meteor G at any cost!
<PUSH>
So let's move on to how we
plan on doing that.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 7]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
We are going to use WAZA's
massive Wave Station, known
as "Dynamic Station"...
<PUSH>
To send Mega Man into
space.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Mega Man!?
<PUSH>
You mean the same Mega
Man that saved us before!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
We will use Dynamic Station
to trans Mega Man into
<PUSH>
Woody's rocket, which is
currently in orbit around
the planet.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 8]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
I'm with you so far, but why
my rocket?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Well...
<PUSH>
Thanks to Magnes going out
of control for a short time,
<PUSH>
your rocket acquired a high
degree of Noise resistance.
<PUSH>
Its resistance is high enough
that the Noise being emitted
<PUSH>
from Meteor G will have little
to no effect on it.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 9]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Do you understand?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Mega Man will trans into the
rocket, then it will get as
close to Meteor G as it can.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Then Mega Man will trans
into Meteor G from the
rocket.
<PUSH>
Is that correct?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Yes it is.
<PUSH>
You two are both very
clever.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Thank you very much for
the compliment, Dr. Goodall!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Finally, Mega Man will destroy
Meteor G's central core.
<PUSH>
It will be very dangerous for
Mega Man, but we have no
other choice...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Umm, I understand what you
have said so far...
<PUSH>
But why have I been called
here?
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 10]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Actually, you have a very
important role to perform.
<PUSH>
Which is of course why we
called you here today.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
A very important role?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Using Dynamic Station to
send Mega Man to Woody's
rocket...
<PUSH>
This involves him being sent
out of Earth's atmosphere
by dynabit transmission.
<PUSH>
The force of this style of
transmission will incur quite
the shock on Mega Man.
<PUSH>
That is why we would like
you to design and build a
<PUSH>
Real Wave protective barrier
that will allow Mega Man to
get to the rocket safely.
<PUSH>
It will have to be an
extraordinarily tough
barrier, to say the least.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
I see...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
We heard that the Real
Wave event stage that you
built was able to hold up,
<PUSH>
even when it was overrun
with out of control Wizards.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
Well, it did freeze up.
<PUSH>
What I did was...
When the Cyber Core was
taken over, I quickly
<PUSH>
rewrote the programming,
creating a firewall.
<PUSH>
Very simply, I reinforced the
event stage's strength.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
There is no one else in all
of Electopia that is able to
<PUSH>
do such a thing in the short
timeframe that you had.
<PUSH>
We really need your help
with this.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
I'll do anything I can to help
protect the planet!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
We have 12 hours until
Meteor G hits Earth...
<PUSH>
There is no time for any
dilly-dallying.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
12 hours{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}
That's going to be tight.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
It's not enough time...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
No, there's actually more
time than you think.

According to my calculations,
there are still 48 hours until
Meteor G strikes.

We have 2 days left.

How is that possible?

Just amazing...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Lee.Stern>
If we have a whole 2 days,
then we can definitely figure
something out!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

Configuring the rocket in
time will be no problem then!

Did you really think dropping
me in a little Noise Wave
would finish me?

Heartless, you've hurt my
feelings.

exist in a Noise Wave for

<Mr.King-2>
Finally catching on, eh?
Think everything through.

The fact is that I am not
human anymore.
