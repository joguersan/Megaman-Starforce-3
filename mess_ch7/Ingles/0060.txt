[SENTENCE NUMBER 3]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I just saw some spots
around here in my head...
<PUSH>
Is that what you meant by
my Dad lending a hand?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
You got it.
<PUSH>
The key you just used
resonated with your father.
<PUSH>
There must be a "memory
splinter" of your father's
around that area you saw.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
A "memory splinter"...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Staying in such close contact
to Meteor G's central core
<PUSH>
has started to scatter
Kelvin's memories...
<PUSH>
If we collect them all, we
might be able to bring back
a special memory of his.
<PUSH>
That memory will turn into
energy, which will then
smash that wall down for us!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Sounds good!!
<PUSH>
Let's use the "Kelvin Key"
to bring back one of Dad's
memories!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
You can't see the "memory
splinters" with your eyes...
<PUSH>
Using the "Kelvin Key" is the
only way to know how many
<PUSH>
there are, as well as where
they are!
<PUSH>
You have to focus, kid!!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>
