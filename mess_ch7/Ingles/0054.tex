<Strong> I would like to use the environmental system's vast amount of data 
processing power to search for Geo!! 
The weather around the island may grow a bit severe while the normal functions 
of the environmental system are offline. 
However, let us all endure for the sake of the boy!! 
+We'll do anything for him!! Let's find him, Strong!! 
{9B}{00}I don't care if a typhoon or something else crazy strikes!! 
I'll tough it out if it's for Geo!! 
<Strong> Thank you, everyone!! 
Let's all make a miracle happen!! 
<Game> *cheers*
