<Game> Two Weeks Later... 
<Geo> Dad... Mega... 
I was able to make it home safely thanks to you. 
I've been having a great time with everyone. 
And I've decided to live my life to its fullest, even if you're not here... 
But every once in a while I get pretty sad... 
.{13}{E1}.{13}{E1}.{13}{E1}I miss both of you so much. 
<Geo> Huh?{16}{E1} What's with that star{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}? 
Is it a blue shooting star{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}?
