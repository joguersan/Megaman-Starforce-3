<Spade-Magnes> Raaaaaarrr!! 
<Megaman> Jack and Ms. Tia should have accessed Meteor G from here! 
<Mega> Argh!! Access has been restricted!! 
They cut it off from the other side!! 
<Megaman> Meteor G... Is going to strike Earth... 
What should we do!? 
<Mega> There's nothing else that we can do here... 
Let's go back and ask that Heartless lady if she knows anything that can help. 
<Megaman> Good idea. 
Maybe she knows something that we don't!
