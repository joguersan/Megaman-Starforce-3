<Megaman> Phew... 
<Mega> Man, I never expected more of those things to show up! Copy freaks!! 
{A8}{00}Mega Man! 
{A8}{00}We will take these two to the hospital for tests. 
<Lee.Stern> The hospital? But I haven't been injured. 
{A8}{00}Yes, but you were in the Noise Wave for some time. 
It would be prudent to have a detailed examination, just to be safe. 
<Lee.Stern> That makes sense... 
<Belle> Oh, I hate hospitals... 
They smell really weird... 
<Ice> You should let a doctor take a look at you, Belle. 
You'll never surpass Sonia if you fall ill. 
{A8}{00}Carrying on... Job well done, Mega Man. 
Stay safe. 
<Megaman> Ah, there's a message... I wonder who it's from? 
<Mega> Take a look. 
<Megaman> A code that will give us access to where King is!? 
{02}{E2}{0B}{00}{A1}{E1} 
<Game> Mega Man got: "Dealer Key"! 
{01}{E2}{0B}{00} 
<Megaman> Who could have...? 
<Mega> Are we going to try it out? 
It could be a trap. 
<Megaman> I have to try. 
If it's a trap, we'll be ready for it. 
<Mega> There should be a door in the Astro Wave that we can open with that key. 
Come on, kid!
