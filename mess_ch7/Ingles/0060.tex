<Megaman> It's a wall of Noise... 
We can't get past it. 
<Mega> Kelvin is on the other side of this thing. 
I think it's time that your Dad lent us a hand. 
<Megaman> What do you mean? 
<Mega> Touch the "Kelvin Key" that your mother gave to you. 
<Megaman> I just saw some spots around here in my head... 
Is that what you meant by my Dad lending a hand? 
<Mega> You got it. 
The key you just used resonated with your father. 
There must be a "memory splinter" of your father's around that area you saw. 
<Megaman> A "memory splinter"... 
<Mega> Staying in such close contact to Meteor G's central core 
has started to scatter Kelvin's memories... 
If we collect them all, we might be able to bring back a special memory of his. 
That memory will turn into energy, which will then smash that wall down for us!! 
<Megaman> Sounds good!! 
Let's use the "Kelvin Key" to bring back one of Dad's memories!! 
<Mega> You can't see the "memory splinters" with your eyes... 
Using the "Kelvin Key" is the only way to know how many 
there are, as well as where they are! 
You have to focus, kid!!
