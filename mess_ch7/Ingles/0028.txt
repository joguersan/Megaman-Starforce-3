They just wouldn't listen to
anything I said.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

I see...

This is not the situation

I talked to Kelvin quite a bit
during that time.
<PUSH>
He was always talking about
forming bonds with other
<PUSH>
worlds, and exchanging
our cultures and ideas.
<PUSH>
I completely agreed with his
views and ideas.
<PUSH>
He is truly a vital part of
this planet's future on a

And that is when I bumped
into King.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Are you sure?

<Heartless>
Yes.
<PUSH>
Kelvin was in an accident in
space, where he became an
EM being, right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Yeah, that's right...
I turned him into an EM
being so that he could
<PUSH>
achieve his dream of
returning to this family.

[SENTENCE NUMBER 8]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
He realized that if he let
it go, then Meteor G would
strike the planet.
<PUSH>
So he transed into the core
of Meteor G, and began to
battle with it.

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
I finally know what happened
to him...
<PUSH>
You tried to make contact
with Dad while King was first
<PUSH>
gaining control of Meteor G,
right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
Exactly.
<PUSH>
My plan was to steal control
of Meteor G away from King,
<PUSH>
call Mega Man there, and
finally have him bring Kelvin
back.
<PUSH>
After that, I would change
Meteor G's flight path, thus
saving Kelvin and the world.
<PUSH>
My plan was perfect...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
But then Jack and Tia got
in the way.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
Yes...
My only miscalculation.
<PUSH>
Because of them, Meteor G
is headed for Earth again.
<PUSH>
By now, there's nothing that
we can do.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
That can't be...
We can't give up!
We're so close!!

There has to be a way to
stop them!!

there is always hope!!

about at the distance limit
for voice communications...

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Go back to WAZA?
<PUSH>
Isn't the area completely
covered by Jamming?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

When King lost control of
Meteor G, the Jamming

covering both WAZA and
