<Geo-2> So this is Jamming... 
<Mega> Such powerful Noise... 
Though we should be fine here, since we are resistant to Noise. 
<Geo-2> That's probably why Mr. Boreal wouldn't let Sonia and Bud come with us. 
They'd be in serious danger just by being this close. 
<Mega> Yeah. So that old lady should be in there somewhere, huh? 
But I don't think we can get in there, even while EM Wave Changed. 
<Geo-2> There's gotta be some way... 
<Mega> {13}{EC}... 
Maybe there is a way, kid. 
<Geo-2> What do you mean? 
<Mega> It looks like your body has gotten more used to Noise. 
So maybe with my awesome strength I could break up some of the Noise. 
<Geo-2> R-Really!? 
<Mega> It won't work everywhere... 
But it just might work in places where the Noise is very weak! 
<Geo-2> Sounds like a plan! You can do this, Mega!! 
<Geo-2> Wizard On!! 
<Mega> You stinkin' Noise... 
Here I come!! 
<Mega> Grrrrrr!! Roooaaar!! 
<Geo-2> Whoa, a bunch of Noise Wave entrances! 
<Mega> We can get in through those!! 
<Geo-2> Dr. Goodall should be in the Noise Wave somewhere! 
We've got to hurry!!
