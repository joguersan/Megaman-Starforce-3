{15}{00}...Where am I? 
...I see. 
It was close, but I was able to escape from the space station somehow... 
Then, thankfully, Omega-Xis was able to turn me into an EM being. 
He must have made this barrier for me too. 
I owe him big time. 
At least I have a chance to make it home this way. 
I'm stuck adrift in space at the moment...

Geo, Hope... 
I'll make it home... I promise. 
{15}{00}Geo... You're such a strong kid. 
You can overcome anything. 
Take care of your mother for me... Hope... 
I won't give up!!
