<Heartless> Mr. King... 
Currently... 
The "orbital base" is in the mesosphere, 50 miles above the planet's surface. 
<Mr.King-2> I see... And how is accessing Meteor G going? 
<Heartless> Everything is going perfectly. 
Thanks to the Crimson that Joker left behind, we were 
able to put Meteor G under control of the orbital base. 
That is to say, Meteor G is completely under your control. 
<Mr.King-2> Ho ho ho... 
Finally, Dealer will... Rather, I will rule the world! 
Heartless... It's time for us to declare our victory to the world. 
They will all learn to fear me! 
<Heartless> Understood, Mr. King.
