W-What's going on!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
The Noise here is extremely
strong!! It's because we're
so close to Meteor G!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Will we be OK!?
<PUSH>
What if the rocket were to
collapse before we accessed
Meteor G?

Magnes!!

<Magnes>
Yup!!
Good to see you, Mega Man!!

There's no time to talk now,
though. I need to boost the

Noise resistance and
suppress these vibrations!!

<Magnes>
When I launched the rocket,
I never would have believed
<PUSH>
that it would be used to
help save the world!
<PUSH>
And on top of that, the
reason it can help is that I
once went out of control,
<PUSH>
which gave it the resistance
to Noise that is necessary!
<PUSH>
How crazy is that!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Magnes...
How close is the rocket to
Meteor G at the moment?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
In other words...
Are we going to make it
there!?

<PUSH>
I'm going to take this thing
as close to Meteor G as I
possibly can, but...
<PUSH>
It looks like you will have to
go through the Noise Wave
to access Meteor G...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
So now we have to go via
a Noise Wave to get there?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
That'll be good enough!
Thanks, Magnes!
