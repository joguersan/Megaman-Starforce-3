[SENTENCE NUMBER 2]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Mr. Boreal! Chief!
I'm so glad to see that you
two are safe!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
It's all thanks to Dr. Goodall.
<PUSH>
Geo, she's OK, right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yeah.
<PUSH>
.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}Wait.
She's not here yet?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
I heard that she is having
an examination at the local
hospital.
<PUSH>
After all, she did spend a
long time in the Noise Wave.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4But, why did she have
us take shelter here?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Yes, yes.
<PUSH>
I was just going to explain
that to you.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 3]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Dr, Goodall!
How is your health!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
There's nothing to worry
about, thank you.
<PUSH>
.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}That being said...
About why I had you all
evacuate to here{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{15}{E1}
<PUSH>
We predicted that Dealer's
first target using Meteor G
would be WAZA...
<PUSH>
And that after the other
WAZA locations were
destroyed, that the main
<PUSH>
computer would be our last
hope...
<PUSH>
Dealer would never let that
remain in our possession.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4So...
<PUSH>
So then you stayed behind
in order to complete certain
counter-measures, correct?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
But, what counter-measures
were they?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
I was completing the
transfer of the main
computer's functions.
<PUSH>
They are now in the
environmental system that
is here in <Castello.Alohaha>.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 4]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4Brilliant!
<PUSH>
The environmental system
certainly has the specs to
<PUSH>
perform the functions of the
main computer properly.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
1Chief!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 6]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
1The analysis of Meteor G
has been completed!
<PUSH>
It is currently resting in
orbit above Earth!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
It's just as King said...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
He's actually able to control
its movement... Not to
mention its other functions.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4He truly is in complete
control of it...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 7]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
If Meteor G were to strike
the planet, every piece of
<PUSH>
technology would be wiped
out.
<PUSH>
However, instead of hitting
Earth with it, he will most
<PUSH>
likely use it as a tool of
fear to control the world.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
I won't let that happen!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Well, we have no idea where
he is now, plus we still have
<PUSH>
to come up with a plan to
stop Meteor G.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Hmm...
<PUSH>
Let's think about it in the
opposite way. If we stop
<PUSH>
Meteor G, then we also ruin
King's plans.
<PUSH>
We still have a chance...
This battle is not over, yet.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4Very well!
<PUSH>
From here on out, I am
designating <Castello.Alohaha>
<PUSH>
as WAZA's new anti-Meteor G
headquarters!!
<PUSH>
Let's hammer out the plans
people!! This is our planet!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
Yes, sir!!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 8]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
So, Geo...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yes?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
The WAZA staff members
are only doing what they are
expected to do.
<PUSH>
Don't try to do too much on
your own, Geo. Just do what
you are capable of doing.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
What I'm capable of doing?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Right now, there is really
nothing that can be done
about Meteor G.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 9]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
What are you talking about!?
"Nothing to be done"!?
<PUSH>
We can take out some
viruses or something!!
Just let us go buck wild!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Hee hee hee...
Oh, Meggers...
<PUSH>
Would you please save up
all that energy for just a
bit longer?
<PUSH>
We'll have you do your part
once we have a plan.
<PUSH>
For now, I want you two to
go back to <Echo.Ridge>.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Back to <Echo.Ridge>...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Yes, your mother must be
worried sick about you.
<PUSH>
Go home and put a smile
on her face.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
She's got a point...
You've been so busy that
you haven't seen her lately.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
OK, Dr. Goodall.
I'll go home for a little while.
<PUSH>
But if anything happens,
please let me know!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
I promise I will.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Alrighty then.
Let's go see your mom!!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>
