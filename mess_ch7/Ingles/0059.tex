<Megaman> Th-That's... 
<Mega> Crimson... 
There's so much of this stuff inside of Meteor G. 
<Megaman> This can't be good. 
<Mega> Heh!! 
I can handle a bunch of Crimson all by myself, no problem! 
Kid! Let's do this just like when we fought those copy freaks at WAZA! 
Press the B Button to make me tear the Crimson to pieces!! 
<Megaman> Got it, Mega! I know you can do it!! 
<Mega> Just remember that if I miss, then the Crimson will attack you head on! 
The Crimson itself doesn't have any bite in its bark, but it will call viruses to it! 
So stay frosty, kid!! 
Oh, one last thing... You won't have a chance to organize your folders or 
save your progress when Crimson attacks you. 
You'll have to select the menu screen while you're dodging those crazy things! 
<Megaman> OK! I'm ready!
