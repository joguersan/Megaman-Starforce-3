<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
It's not...
over yet!
<PUSH>
I'm not giving up after all
we've been through!

Yes, you did lose so much
that was special in your life
through technology...

But{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}
You still have Jack. That
bond hasn't been broken...

<Megaman>
If you really let Meteor G
crash into the planet...
<PUSH>
All the pain and suffering
that Jack and you went
<PUSH>
through would be transferred
to countless children
throughout the world.
<PUSH>
How is that any different
than what those other
countries did to your own!?

I think Geo is right...

We've been wrong all along...
<PUSH>
What we've been planning will
not remake the world...
<PUSH>
Our plan would just make a
whole lot of children like us.
<PUSH>
That's "destruction", not
"construction".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
The suffering caused by the
development of technology
should end with us.

Ace and Geo have risked
their lives over and over to
get us to understand...

up for what we've done, but
we will do everything we can.

The future...
Is in your hands.

Once I've made up for all
