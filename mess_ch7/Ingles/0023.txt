<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
New information has come
in, Mr. King.
<PUSH>
Leaders from all over the
world are debating over
<PUSH>
whether they should or
should not submit to Dealer.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
They truly are idiots...
<PUSH>
They still can't understand
the fact that there is no
<PUSH>
one who can defeat me, as
long as I control Meteor G.
<PUSH>
Let them debate.
<PUSH>
They will never find a means
to prevail over me.
<PUSH>
And when the time comes
when they realize that, they
<PUSH>
will fall to their knees
and beg for forgiveness!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
It shall be as you say,
Mr. King.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
By the way...
<PUSH>
Have you learned anything
about whoever is causing
<PUSH>
problems with my control
over Meteor G?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
Unfortunately...
There has been no break
in information, yet...

Otherwise, you will pay!!

Queen Tia! Jack!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
How did you get in here?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Queen.Virgo>
You'd be better off if you
didn't take us so lightly...
<PUSH>
Anyone with half a brain
could escape from the
<PUSH>
Satella Police and break into
this place.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
So then it is you two who
have been interfering with
my control of Meteor G!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Queen.Virgo>
{13}{EC}.{13}{E1}.{13}{E1}.{13}{E1}?
<PUSH>
I have no idea what you are
talking about.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack.Corvus>
Sis and I have been waiting
a very long time for this
exact moment...
<PUSH>
The moment when Joker is
out of the picture, and you
are in control of Meteor G!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Queen.Virgo>
We can finally make our
"wish" come true...
<PUSH>
King!!
<PUSH>
We're taking over both
Dealer and Meteor G!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Ho ho...
<PUSH>
So you are telling me that
you are taking everything
I have from me?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack.Corvus>
You got it, you jerk!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
You must be insane, child...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Who was the person that
raised you after you lost
your parents and home?
<PUSH>
Was it not me?
<PUSH>
I cannot believe that my
own children would stab me
in the back like this.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Queen.Virgo>
Oh spare us the benevolent
father figure routine!
<PUSH>
Yes, you established the
"King Foundation", in which
you took orphans in from
<PUSH>
around the world and had
them cared for...
<PUSH>
But the foundation was just
a cover for your real work.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack.Corvus>
You had a completely
different reason for
gathering all those children.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack.Corvus>
You choose the children with
the most promise, and made
them your subordinates.
<PUSH>
Then you had them commit
all of your crimes for you.
<PUSH>
Sis and I were just two of
those children.
<PUSH>
{13}{E2}{01}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Queen.Virgo>
However...
Over time, those children
were sent into extremely
<PUSH>
dangerous situations by
your command.
<PUSH>
And none of them, except
us, ever came back!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Queen.Virgo>
They never even
considered that they were
only being used by you!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
It was because of me that
they even lived long enough
to serve me.
<PUSH>
They should have been
thanking me for that!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Queen.Virgo>
Shut your mouth!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack.Corvus>
Right here, right now...
<PUSH>
You will pay for what you
did to us and all of the
other children!!
<PUSH>
King!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Queen.Virgo>
You're going down!!

Argh!
This isn't right!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
This whole facility is under
my direct control.

In other words, everything
here becomes as I desire.

Now it is time...

For you two naughty children
to be punished.

Joker was the last of your

Actually, he was only your
Wizard so that he could fulfill
his own Purpose...

You have been surrounded

So what game are you
playing here, lady?

I've been waiting for the
opportunity to take King out.

When the moment came I
had to take my shot.
<PUSH>
That is all.

But I actually expected Mega
Man to show up.

I never even considered
that you two would get here
before him.

We appreciate you helping
us out...

To send Meteor G...

<Heartless>
{13}{EC}...

Are you crazy?
<PUSH>
You must know what would
happen if Meteor G were to
crash into the Earth.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Of course we know.
<PUSH>
We are now going to the
main Cyber Core of this
<PUSH>
facility to overwrite the
programming.
<PUSH>
Then we will delete King's
control access, and reset
its original course for Earth.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
Using Meteor G, we will be
able to destroy every piece
of technology in the world...

That is our "wish".

I don't want to make you
