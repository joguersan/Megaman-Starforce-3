<Hope(Mom)> Geo, where were you!? 
The world has been in a panic and I haven't been able to get a hold of you... 
You have no idea how worried I was!! 
<Geo> I-I'm really sorry. There was... 
{12}{E2}!{01}{00} 
<Hope(Mom)> Geo... Never make me worry like that ever again... 
With your father missing... 
I don't have anyone else left. 
<Geo-2> Mom... 
<Hope(Mom)> What would I do if I were to lose you? 
My whole world would collapse around me if I lost the both of you. 
And I can't bear to feel the same kind of pain as when your father disappeared. 
<Geo-2> {13}{EC}... 
<Hope(Mom)> ...I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this. 
It's late, so let's just get some sleep... 
<Geo-2> OK... 
<Geo-2> It's a... A message from Ace? 
H-How is that possible...!? 
<Game> Geo got Battle Card: "{09}{E8}"! 
<Game> Geo got Battle Card: "{04}{E8}"! 
<Geo-2> Ace... 
<Mega> That guy{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} 
Never stopped fighting for the people special to him... 
<Geo-2> {13}{EC}(I'm sorry, Mom...)
