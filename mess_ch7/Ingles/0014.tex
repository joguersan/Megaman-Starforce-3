<Mr.King-2> .{16}{E1}.{16}{E1}.{16}{E1}Strange. 
<Heartless> {13}{EC}...? 
Is there something wrong, Mr. King? 
<Mr.King-2> Meteor G is not utilizing 100% of its power... 
It should be able to produce much more powerful Jamming. 
Its Jamming should be able to block all EM beings from entering or leaving, plus all 
humans that are touched by it should be destroyed. 
<Heartless> But Meteor G is completely under your control. 
There is no way that it can deny your orders... 
<Mr.King-2> That means that there is someone outside of WAZA that is interfering with me. 
But who could it be...? 
Who would wait until the last moment to strike at me? 
Heartless! 
Look into this for me!! 
<Heartless> Yes, Mr. King.
