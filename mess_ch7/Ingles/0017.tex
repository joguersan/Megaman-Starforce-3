<Geo-2> Lee!? And Belle too!? 
<Mega> What the heck is going on? 
<Lee.Stern> We understand the danger of sending this out, but we could not stay silent. 
Everyone from around the world who is watching this!! 
We cannot give in to Dealer!! 
We've got to fight for our hopes and dreams, for the future, until the very end!! 
We can't lose if we all combine our energy and effort into the cause!! 
<Belle> Don't give up, everyone! 
<Ice> We need Wizards to stand up too!! 
<Mega> So it's a call to unite, huh? 
They're trying to get the whole world to cooperate. 
<Geo-2> What they're doing is too dangerous! 
If King finds out what they're doing... 
<Mega> They said that they understand the danger. 
They know they're risking their lives sending this out! 
<Geo-2> Get away from there, Lee!! Run!! 
<Geo-2> {13}{EC}!! 
<Mega> King!! 
<Mr.King-2> Foolish rebels... 
It appears as if you have already forgotten the greatness of my power. 
<Geo-2> King, no!! 
<Mr.King-2> I suppose I will have to refresh your memories!!
