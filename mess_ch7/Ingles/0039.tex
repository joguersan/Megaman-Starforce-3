<Jack.Corvus> Nice... I was hoping you would make it this far... Mega Man... 
<Megaman> {13}{EC}!! 
<Megaman> Jack!! 
<Jack.Corvus> The name's Jack Corvus... 
<Wolf.Woods> Ohohoho... Finally, our chance to really fight has come, Omega-Xis. 
I'm going to destroy you!! 
<Mega> Actually, you're the one that's going D-O-W-N! 
Don't mistake me for who I was so long ago, Corvus! 
<Jack.Corvus> You will not stop our wish from coming true. 
Your time in this existence ends now. 
<Megaman> I'm fighting to protect the people that I love, and all the people of Earth! 
Your wish will remain only a pathetic pipe dream!! 
<Jack.Corvus> If you think you're that tough, then bring it!! 
This is the end for the "Hero of Justice"!! 
<Megaman> Meteor G is next after I'm done with you!! 
Wave Battle! Ride On!!
