<Megaman> We left those two to the Satella Police, but... 
<Mega> They're still not back yet. 
{A8}{00}Rescue complete! 
<Megaman> Lee and Belle! I'm glad to see that you two are safe! 
<Lee.Stern> {13}{EC}...? 
Umm, how do you know our names, Mega Man? 
<Belle> Hmm... I'm pretty sure that we've met before... 
<Ice> I remember that. 
Thank you, again. 
<Megaman> {13}{EC}(Oops...  I totally forgot that they 
 don't know my true identity.  Way to almost blow it, Geo..) 
N-Not a problem... 
{13}{E2}{00}{00} 
<Game> Ahhhhhh!! 
{A8}{00}More c-copies!! 
<Megaman> Lee, Belle, run!! 
{A8}{00}Follow me! 
<Mega> Bring it on, you imitators!!
