<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
I want to explain, in short,
exactly what has been going
on lately.
<PUSH>
Geo Stelar...
...And Omega-Xis.

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Enough beating around the
bush! Just get to the point
already.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Do you know anything about
who you fought in <Alohaha>?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
There was Ms. Tia...
And Jack...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
And there was that real evil
looking guy, Joker, too.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
They're all members of the
organization called Dealer.
<PUSH>
{12}{E2}{15}{00}{01}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
That's correct.
Dealer is lead by Mr. King.
<PUSH>
It's a group of cyber
criminals.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Mr. King?
<PUSH>
The famous philanthropist
Mr. King?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Yes, the very same.
<PUSH>
His charity work is just a
front for his real activities...
<PUSH>
His true aim is to wreak
havoc on the world through
cyber crimes.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Another detestable lowlife
for us to play with...!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Mr. King...!
<PUSH>
{13}{EC}(So he's the boss of the
 {13}{EC}organization that Ms. Tia,
 {13}{EC}Jack, and Joker work for!)
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
That whole group is a
complete pain in the butt.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid>
Everyday life has become
more convenient thanks to
the impact of EM technology.
<PUSH>
However, on the other hand...
<PUSH>
Cyber crimes that make use
of that technology have
been rising drastically.
<PUSH>
As life has become more
convenient, almost as if
laughing in the face of
<PUSH>
society, cyber crimes have
grown more complicated and
larger in scale.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Exactly.
<PUSH>
And every time the evidence
leads directly to them...
<PUSH>
Recently, they have been
using data cards filled with
<PUSH>
Noise to make Wizards go
out of control{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Noise Cards... Right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Yeah.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
They really sound like a
bunch of scumbags!
<PUSH>
Let's tear 'em to pieces, kid!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
W-What a second, Mega!
Now isn't the time for that...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
You'll get your chance.
<PUSH>
Queen Tia, who you know as
Ms. Tia, and Jack, are key
members of Dealer.
<PUSH>
You did very well battling
Jack.
<PUSH>
I think you guys are on the
correct path.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Bah!
Next time, we'll win for sure!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
However, Joker isn't...
<PUSH>
He isn't someone you could
handle at the moment.
<PUSH>
But Acid and I...
<PUSH>
We could probably pull
something off...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
What are you saying!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Having him in Dealer has
proven to be quite a
nuisance for us.
<PUSH>

Doc...
Unfortunately...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Unbelievable...
I just can't believe that it's
come to this...

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Doc...
I'm very sorry.

Yet, at the moment...

<Ace>
Ahem!
<PUSH>
I should introduce everyone.
<PUSH>
This is Dr. Goodall.
<PUSH>
She is the head of the
Satella Police Science
Department...

She's quite an impressive
individual.

Well, then...
How about "Meggers"!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
O-OK, Lady!
Quit fooling around!
<PUSH>
I'll go buck wild all over this
place if you keep this up!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid>
...Give it a rest, Omega-Xis.
<PUSH>
Dr. Goodall is the most
strong-willed individual you will
ever meet.

Umm...
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Geo Stelar.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Yes, Arthur has told me
everything about you.
<PUSH>
...Your dear friend is in quite
a bind, isn't she?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Yeah...
Mr. Boreal told me that if
<PUSH>
anyone can help, it
would be you...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
So you're friends with Aaron
as well, eh?
<PUSH>
He's such a good boy.
<PUSH>
And he's going to be a
splendid scientist someday!

They have to know the
truth from the beginning.
<PUSH>
{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}Geo, this is quite a difficult
case.

A person's life is in the
balance. So I can make no
promises.

Science is not perfect and
almighty.

give up. Just like Kelvin!

<Geo>
Y-{15}{E1}You know my dad!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
That shouldn't be such a
surprise, should it?
<PUSH>
Just one look at me should
tell you that I've been
around for while now.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
{15}{E1}Ahem!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Well, we can talk about your
father another time... OK?

For now, I know that I don't
have to worry anymore.
<PUSH>
You'll make a great scientist
someday!
I guarantee it!

First, I need to know
exactly what happened.
<PUSH>
That's step number one.
<PUSH>
So I'm going to repair your
friend's <Hunter>, as well as
her Wizard.

It's going to take a little
while... Do you mind waiting?

Not at all!
Thank you so much!
