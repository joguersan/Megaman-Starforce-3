<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
...Queen Tia was captured
by the Satella Police?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
That's correct.
<PUSH>
But the assault lead by her
wiped out most of WAZA and
the Satella Police.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Then I suppose the assault
proved to be a success.
<PUSH>
It is so close...!
<PUSH>
The day that I use
Meteor G to take over the
planet is so close!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
Indeed.
<PUSH>
{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}By the way, Mr. King.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Yes, what is it?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
What should be done about
Jack?
<PUSH>
He is not behaving himself,
to put it mildly.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Ha ha ha!
He isn't, is he!?
<PUSH>
Get rid of him.
Queen Tia and him were just
simple pawns from the start.
<PUSH>
When you lose someone, you
grow numb and careless.
<PUSH>
And as for Jack, he is not
capable of much without his
sister by his side.
<PUSH>
He is of no use...yet.
<PUSH>
{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}Yet.
<PUSH>

<Mr.King-2>
Some parental feelings still
linger within myself.

Let him stay and do as he
pleases.
<PUSH>
...Hah hah hah!

<Heartless>
Yes, sir.
