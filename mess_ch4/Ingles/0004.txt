<Mr.Boreal>
...Yes, I heard that Luna has
gone missing...
<PUSH>
You all have gotten
yourselves into quite a pickle
this time around...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Yeah...
<PUSH>
That's why we came to talk
to you, Mr. Boreal...
<PUSH>
We thought maybe WAZA, or
even you, might be willing to
help us out.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
I see...

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Geo...
<PUSH>
I still haven't told you why
I am here, have I...?
<PUSH>
I was requested by WAZA to
repair this environmental
system.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
By WAZA...!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
During the repair process,
I stumbled upon Strong...
Or, what was left of him.
<PUSH>
...He was torn to shreds and
his data was scattered all
over the place.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
{13}{EC}!!
<PUSH>
{13}{EC}(Because of what
{13}{EC} Joker did to him...!)

<PUSH>
{12}{E2}!{00}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
I desperately searched for
the rest of his data.
<PUSH>
And luckily I was able to find
it{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} In short, I've managed to
reconstruct Strong.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
...I think that's the longest
word that I've ever heard...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
"Reconstruct" means "to put
back together".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
D-Does that mean...
<PUSH>
Does that mean that you
brought Strong back to life!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
That's amazing, Mr. Boreal!

<Strong>
{13}{EC}...

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}Strong?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Geo...
<PUSH>
I am certain that I have put
him back to his original self.
<PUSH>
But he is not the same as
he was before...
<PUSH>
There just wasn't enough
data.
<PUSH>
Some data must have been
destroyed when he was torn
apart.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
What...!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Everyone, listen.
<PUSH>
As far as I know, Luna and
Strong were destroyed by
the same weapon.
<PUSH>
If that is true, then Luna
could be in the same state
that Strong was.
<PUSH>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>
That is all I know at the
moment{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
But, Mr. Boreal!
<PUSH>
Strong came back to life!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Y-Yeah!
<PUSH>
Please put Prez back
together again!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
I'm sorry, everyone...
<PUSH>
I was able to bring Strong
back to life because he is
a program created by people.
<PUSH>
...Because I was able to
compensate for the missing
data with a new program.
<PUSH>
Luna is a human being, made
of flesh and blood.
<PUSH>
There's nothing I can do...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

N-No way...

There is nothing that I can
do, but I think I may know

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Dr. Goodall is the woman in
charge of the Satella Police
Science Department.

She is recognized as one of
the most brilliant scientists

If anyone can help, it's her...

Dr. Goodall of the Satella
Police...!

This is the security gate
passcode.

A touch panel to input the

stand in front of the gate.

Please input the passcode
with the touch panel once
it has popped up.

there. See you soon.

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
There's something I've been
wanting to ask you...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
What is it...?
<PUSH>
{12}{E2}<(Queen)Tia>
{00}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
It's about Noise.
<PUSH>
Once you EM Wave Change
into Mega Man, you should
<PUSH>
feel the effects of Noise
that is around you.
<PUSH>
Noise has been building up
more and more each day.
<PUSH>
You haven't had anything
strange happen?
No problems at all?
<PUSH>
If anything bad should
happen, I would feel
responsible.
<PUSH>
I could never look your
parents in the eye again.
<PUSH>
If you ever feel even just
a little bit strange, you
should stop...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
There's nothing to worry
about, Mr. Boreal!
<PUSH>
Noise isn't a problem!
<PUSH>
Ace, the man I just spoke
to, gave me an anti-Noise
program to use!
<PUSH>
It's the Satella Police's most
powerful program!
<PUSH>
It allows me to see how
much Noise is around by
showing me the Noise Level!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Well, simply put...
<PUSH>
It's something that lets us
control Noise!
<PUSH>
And it gives us the ability to
acquire illegal data!
Isn't that sweet!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Heh heh{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}
Well, I suppose for now
there's no reason to worry.
<PUSH>
You can trust anything that
comes from Dr. Goodall and
the Satella Police.
<PUSH>
{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}But, Geo...
<PUSH>
I don't want to scare you,
but there is still a lot that
we don't know about Noise...
<PUSH>
One theory claims that it
accumulates inside of
EM beings.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
{13}{EC}!!
<PUSH>
Accumulates...!?
So more and more builds up
inside of them!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Yes.
<PUSH>
Right now, that program is
helping, but...
<PUSH>
Problems could possibly
arise from being around
Noise for too long.
<PUSH>
...Please be careful.
<PUSH>
Don't overdo it, OK?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
O-OK...!
<PUSH>
I promise to be careful!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
...Great!

Yeah...

OK, Mr. Boreal...!

I promise to never give up
and never surrender.
