<Ace>
What the...
<PUSH>
There's a swarm of{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}
Omega-Xis' outside.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
0A-Actually...
<PUSH>
None of them are
Omega-Xis.
<PUSH>
According to Dr. Goodall, all
of them are simply copies...
<PUSH>
It's possible that they are
a Dealer weapon!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
A Dealer weapon...
<PUSH>
That makes sense. It would
be less trouble to copy
something, instead of
<PUSH>
developing your own.
But, making this many must
have been quite a task....
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 3]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
1The number of enemy
Wizards has increased!
<PUSH>
But I can't make out an
enemy frequency...
<PUSH>
They're all giving off
Omega-Xis's exact frequency!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
So their power levels could
be the same, as well.
<PUSH>
That wouldn't be fun.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
0For the moment, all we can
do is prevent them from
breaking in!
<PUSH>
Deploy the first unit!
<PUSH>
Evacuate all of the civilian
WAZA staff!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
1Yes, sir!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 4]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
{13}{EC}(We might have been
{13}{EC} able to detect them
{13}{EC} if Acid was here.)
<PUSH>
...I guess there's no point in
asking, "What if?".
<PUSH>
{10}{E2}{36}{03}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
*beep, beep, beep*
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Arthur.
<PUSH>
It looks like we've stepped
into something icky.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 5]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Yeah.
<PUSH>
So, {15}{E1}is there anything that
can be done?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Actually, there is...
<PUSH>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>
Since the enemies are EM
beings, we can use "that".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
By "that", you mean{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}
<PUSH>
The "Noise Canceller"?
<PUSH>
Isn't that still being tested?
<PUSH>
And on top of that...
Isn't it top secret?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
We'll never be able to try it
if HQ is ransacked and the
device is destroyed.
<PUSH>
I feel that the risk is worth
the reward, don't you?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
...Yes. Understood.
<PUSH>
How long will it take until
it's ready?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Forever if we don't have
Acid return and help out...
<PUSH>
Once he is back...
<PUSH>
He can analyze the data
from the Meggers copies,
<PUSH>
and alter the Noise Canceller
program to work on them.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Where are you now, Doc?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
In the WAZA main computer
room.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
OK, try not to move from
there.
<PUSH>
I'll buy us some time while
you get that Noise Canceller
ready.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
OK.
But don't overdo it, Arthur.
<PUSH>
{10}{E2}{95}{03}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
...*beep!*

Well...

Hero of Justice's debut!
