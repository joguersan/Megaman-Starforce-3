<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid>
...Thank you for getting here
just in time, Mega Man.
<PUSH>
Now, we can get you started
on your "mission".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
"Mission"...{15}{E1}!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
At the moment, Dr. Goodall
is using the main computer
to prepare our trump card
<PUSH>
that can wipe out all of the
enemy in one shot.
<PUSH>
But it's still going to take
some time to complete...
<PUSH>
We have to buy all the time
we can for Dr. Goodall!
<PUSH>
All of the officers and
Battle Wizards are rallying
to work together and
<PUSH>
combine their power to
protect the main computer!
<PUSH>
It's going to be rough...{15}{E1}
<PUSH>
But do you think you can
handle it?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
...
<PUSH>
Of course!
<PUSH>
{13}{EC}(If WAZA isn't...
{13}{EC} If the main computer
{13}{EC} isn't protected, then
<PUSH>
{13}{EC} we won't be able to
{13}{EC} reconstruct Prez...!)
<PUSH>
{13}{EC}(We have no choice!)
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Hmph!
I don't even care about
your plan!
<PUSH>
I'll go crazy if I let such
poor quality copies of me
exist any longer!
<PUSH>
I'm gonna go buck wild and
tear them all to pieces!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
M-Mega!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Grrr!
<PUSH>
And no squishy humans or
regular old Battle Wizards
better get in my way...
<PUSH>
Or else they'll end up like
those copy freaks!!
<PUSH>
Everyone's better off just
leaving everything to me!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Whoa!
You need to chill out!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Another wave...!?
I guess I'm not going to
have snack time today!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid>
At the moment, it matters
not what you are fighting
for.
<PUSH>
Mega Man, your mission is
to stop any enemies that
try to destroy the shield.
<PUSH>
Ace and I will protect the
inside of WAZA.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Acid, you jerk!
Who gave you the right to-
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Understood!
We'll stay here and protect
the shield!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
The shield is a vital part
of WAZA's defenses.
<PUSH>
I trust you, Geo.
<PUSH>
...And Omega-Xis, too!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
So then stop asking for our
help only when you have no
other choice!
<PUSH>
...Grrr!
<PUSH>
And why don't you stop
using big words like "mission",
<PUSH>
and just tell us to tear to
pieces any bad guys that
come near the shield!?
<PUSH>
Short and sweet is the way
to go!
<PUSH>
We don't need some crazy
hour long tutorial!
<PUSH>
Right, kid!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Umm, sure, what you said.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<HarpNote>
Geo! I'm going to stay here
with you and help protect
the shield, too!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
...Well...
<PUSH>
I was hoping to have you
help with defending the main
computer room.
<PUSH>
Just in case...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<HarpNote>
I see...
B-But...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
You don't have to worry
about me, Sonia!
<PUSH>
It's best if you help keep
Dr. Goodall, Bud and Zack
safe.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<HarpNote>
...OK.
<PUSH>
But don't do anything too
stupid, OK?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
OK, I promise!
<PUSH>

Alright, Acid.
How about we go buck wild
for once!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Ace...
Be careful!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
I will...
And Geo,{15}{E1} you do the same.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Grrrrrr!!
Man, he's so annoying!
<PUSH>
I just can't stand him!!
<PUSH>
...I'm so mad, no one's gonna
even lay a freakin' finger on
me today!
<PUSH>
Hey, kid!
Listen real good to my
explanation, OK!?
<PUSH>
Basically, you aren't going
to do the actual fighting.
<PUSH>
I need you to run around
and aim at the copies.
<PUSH>
Press the B Button and I'll
tear them up with my claws!
<PUSH>
But if the timing is off and
we miss, then you're going to
have to join the fight.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Got it!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
There isn't even going to be
a second available to look
<PUSH>
at your <Hunter> and do
things like pulse out...
<PUSH>
So you better organize your
folder how you like it, now!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
OK!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
This battle will be lost if
the shield behind us is
<PUSH>
destroyed, or if we kick the
bucket...
<PUSH>
But we'll be victorious if
we delete every last one of
them!!
<PUSH>
Are you all set!?
