I never expected to see
you all here!!
<PUSH>
What are you guys doing
here!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-swim>
We're on a school trip.
<PUSH>
What about you?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia-swim>
I'm doing a photo shoot for
my next album cover.
<PUSH>
We wanted to give the album
a tropical feel, so we were
taking photos here today.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud-swim>
S-Sonia...!
You really looked great
for the TV show recording...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack-swim>
And your bathing suit looks
very nice!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia-swim>
Hee hee, thanks!

But now I'm a little
embarrassed.

<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia-swim>
But...
This beach was supposed to
be reserved for the shoot...
<PUSH>
...I guess it's already past
the reservation time.
<PUSH>
What should I do...?
<PUSH>
I should probably tell my
agent that there's a bit of
a problem...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-swim>
A problem?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia-swim>
Yeah...
<PUSH>
Actually, a part of the
stone wall that's set up
here is a Real Wave.
<PUSH>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 3]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia-swim>
Yeah, and...
<PUSH>
The stone wall was supposed
to be changed into a flower
<PUSH>
bed of hibiscus, so we could
get a few more photos.
<PUSH>
But it seems like there are
some viruses in there, so
we couldn't get it to change.
<PUSH>
Then a really big Wizard
showed up and told us to
leave it to him.
<PUSH>
Then he went into the
Cyber Core.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-swim>
So what happened to the
Wizard?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia-swim>
He still hasn't come back..
<PUSH>
And it's been quite a while
since he went in...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Hey, kid...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-swim>
Yeah...
I wonder what's up with that
Wizard...?
<PUSH>
We should EM Wave Change
and check it out.
