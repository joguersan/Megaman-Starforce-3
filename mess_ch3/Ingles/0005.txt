Whoa...
This doesn't feel anything
like Electopia...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
It's really got that tropical
island feel!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
As everyone already knows...
This is Electopia's most
southern island, <Alohaha>.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
I never would have thought
I'd get to go to <Alohaha> for
a school trip!
<PUSH>
What a great year this is!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
The King Foundation has
made a donation to every
school in Electopia in order
<PUSH>
to give kids the chance to
experience places they never
had the chance to visit.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
The King Foundation is
always doing great things
to make everyone happy!

Amazing!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
So that's the famous

<(Queen)Tia>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>
The king who used to rule
this island lived within the
great <Castello.Alohaha>...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
So is there still a king living
in there!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
No. Because this island is
part of Electopia there is
no king...
<PUSH>
Instead, there is a powerful
"environmental system" inside.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
According to my Wizard...
<PUSH>
The "environmental system"
keeps <Alohaha> in constant
<PUSH>
summer, and even protects
it from natural disasters!
<PUSH>
It's Electopia's most
renowned super system!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
A-Awesome!!
I have to see it!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Geez, you really love that
kind of stuff, don't you, kid?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
Tomorrow's schedule is full,
so if you really want to see
it, you should go today.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
Moving on... The environmental
system is not controlled by
a person, but by a Wizard.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
A Wizard!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
That's correct...
He is a completely
autonomous Wizard...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
So he's independent from
a <Hunter>...
<PUSH>
He must be super powerful!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
His name is "Strong"...
<PUSH>
And he is revered as a
"guardian deity" of the island.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

<Mr.Shepar>
Yes, Luna?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Since this trip is a special
event we don't get to do
<PUSH>
often, do you mind if we all
change our Purpose for the
trip?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
Oh, that's not a bad idea.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Is it really OK to change
our Team's Purpose?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
This is a time for us to
make great memories
together!
<PUSH>
And also to forget all of
our worries!
<PUSH>
Since we came as a class, I
think we should all share the
same Purpose during the trip!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
Great idea!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Geo, why don't you pick the
new Purpose!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
...Huh?
Y-You want me to pick it!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
I believe in you, Geo!
<PUSH>
We'll spend today and
tomorrow living by the
Purpose that you pick!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
You can do it!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Hmm...
<PUSH>
How about...
A "Trip to Remember"?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Oooh, that sounds good.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
Well then, let's set Class
5-A's Purpose as a
"Trip to Remember"!

same Purpose...

...Yuck.

W-What do you want!?
Don't come any closer!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
You didn't change your
Purpose. That's no good.
<PUSH>
We're all supposed to have
the same Purpose!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Just leave me alone!
It's my decision!

<NEW-DIALOG>

Not. A. Chance.

So... What should we do?
<PUSH>
Since we came all this way, I
think we should check out
the environmental system.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I wouldn't mind seeing it, too...
<PUSH>
I want to see what that
Wizard, Strong, is like.
<PUSH>

We're off to <Castello.Alohaha>!
