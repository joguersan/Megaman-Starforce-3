<Ace>
I'm sorry I made you late
for your school trip to
{53}{E2}, Geo.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I don't mind being late for
the trip, Ace.
<PUSH>
You've done a lot for Sonia,
Belle, and everyone else.
So I'm happy to help.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
That means a lot, Geo.
<PUSH>
I wonder what really
happened at <Studi.WBG>?
<PUSH>
I'm on the Satella Police
investigation team.
<PUSH>
And I realized the only
way to find out is to ask
Mega Man...
<PUSH>
Or rather... You, Geo.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Him knowing all about you
is getting annoying, kid.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
I heard that, Omega-Xis.

It appears you were

{13}{EC}!!
<PUSH>
Y-You...
How do you know that...!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Don't be surprised.
<PUSH>
Satella Police's information
recon is unrivaled.

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
So what do you want
to know?
<PUSH>
{13}{E2}{01}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
When you were Mega Man,
did anything strange
happen to you?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Strange?
<PUSH>
...Actually, yeah.
My body went numb.
It was pretty terrible.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Hmm...
<PUSH>
I see...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Grrr!!
If you've got something to
say, then say it already!
<PUSH>
You and your Wizard
are always thinking and
never speaking!
<PUSH>
That really gets to me!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid>
*sigh*
I've never met a more
short tempered Wizard.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Shut it!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Cool it, Mega...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Well...
I guess it's better than
letting it all build up inside.
<PUSH>
So... You've fought with out
of control Wizards several
times now, right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yes.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
When a Wizard goes out
of control, a vast amount
of Noise is released...
<PUSH>
That Noise is very
dangerous for EM beings...
<PUSH>
If a Wizard absorbs too
much Noise, he could be
deleted.
<PUSH>

<Geo>
Deleted!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Holy cow...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
When a device goes out
of control, its EM waves
can be corrupted...
<PUSH>
That's really what Noise is.
<PUSH>
So from now on, you need
to stay very alert...
<PUSH>
But for now...
<PUSH>
I'll give you my <AcePrgm>...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
"<AcePrgm>"?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
What's that?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
It's a Satella Police special
weapon, as well as my pride
and joy!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Really?
Is it really OK for me to
take something like that?
<PUSH>

You're the only one that I
would trust with it{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
{13}{EC}...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Just consider it an early
birthday present, OK?
<PUSH>
So... I should tell you what
it actually does...
<PUSH>
Quite simply, it's a device
that gives you the ability
to control Noise.
<PUSH>
I'm going to send it to your
<Hunter>-VG now.

"{C2}{E6}"?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
What's that?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
It's the most powerful and
terrible of all programs that
<PUSH>
the Satella Police have in
their possession.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Geez... Are you sure it's OK
for me to take something
so powerful?
<PUSH>

Don't worry, I know you can
handle it{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}

[SENTENCE NUMBER 8]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
With this you can control
Noise enough that you won't
be deleted.
<PUSH>
Also, during battles the
Noise Level will now be
displayed.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
What the heck is that?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
In short, it's a number that
shows you how much Noise
is being emitted around you.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Noise Level...
<PUSH>
Sounds like an awesome
program!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
<PUSH>
You should definitely spend
some time getting used to
using it.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Good idea!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
{13}{EC}(Man, Geo is such
 a science maniac...)
<PUSH>
So... Will anything change
along with the Noise Level?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Most definitely.
<PUSH>
The most simple change is
that when the Noise Level
<PUSH>
is at 100% or higher when
the final enemy is deleted,
<PUSH>
you will acquire Illegal Data
on top of regular data.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Illegal Data?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid>
It's data that has been
altered by Noise.
<PUSH>
You won't know what you'll
get until you've actually
acquired it.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
He's being "Mr. Vague", again...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
There are other types of
changes that occur along
with the Noise Level.
<PUSH>
But I'm positive that you'll
be able to handle them just
fine, Geo...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
{13}{EC}...?
<PUSH>
{13}{EC}(I wonder what's wrong?
 Ace looks like he's
 feeling pretty down.)
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Well, that's it for all the
serious talk!
<PUSH>
But please don't forget this
this much, Geo.
<PUSH>
When a Wizard goes out of
control, do your best not to
<PUSH>
fight, and just wait for the
Satella Police to arrive.
<PUSH>
Noise is too dangerous to
play around with.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
U-understood.
<PUSH>

Yet, Mega Man has already
absorbed a considerable
amount of Noise...

But with absolutely no
noticeable effects...

assumed...

What does this pop-up do?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
It lets you access the
Astro Wave.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

Astro Wave?

Yeah, it's a Wave Road
that's in space.

<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
You can get to the Astro
Wave from the highest point
<PUSH>
of the Wave Road in
<Echo.Ridge>.
<PUSH>
There's a lot of viruses
there, so be extra careful.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Is it really OK!?
<PUSH>
It's not a problem that a kid
like me can access such an
amazing place!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Usually, it would never be
allowed. But like I said, I
owe you for making you late.
<PUSH>
You can get to <Alohaha> in
no time at all, using the
Astro Wave.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Thanks, Ace!
<PUSH>
Astro Wave...
A Wave Road in space...
<PUSH>
I can't wait!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Haha. Your excitement is
making me want to jump
up and down too.

Well, have fun on your
school trip.
