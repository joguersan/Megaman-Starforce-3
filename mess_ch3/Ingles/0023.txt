<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
What did you find...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Mega Man still has a great
potential for power beyond
his current levels.
<PUSH>
And it turns out that Geo
Stelar's Wizard, Omega-Xis,
holds the key...
<PUSH>
It's just as we expected...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
What about the data on
Omega-Xis?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>

more problems, now.

So you're collecting Crimson...

It's thanks to you that we
got so much...

Tell me what the heck is
going on!

{13}{EC}!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
So it is true...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
Under the orders of the
head of Dealer, Mr. King, we
<PUSH>
joined Echo Ridge Elementary
to investigate Mega Man.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
We made Wizards go out of
control... In order to acquire
data on you.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Jack...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
And at the same time, we
collected all of the Crimson
<PUSH>
that was released in
battles.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Why Crimson...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
Because Mr. King wants it...
<PUSH>
And it's very important
to us, as well...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
We almost have too much
data now...
<PUSH>
And we have more than
enough Crimson thanks to
you.
<PUSH>
That makes our mission
complete.
<PUSH>
...Which means we have no
more use for you.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
We can't just let you go
back home after all of this.
<PUSH>
Looks like we'll just have to
take down Mega Man, the
hero of justice...
<PUSH>
Our Wizards really want
to do this as well...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Your Wizards...?

countless worlds...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Wolf.Woods>
Heeey...
What's wrong, Omega-Xis!?
<PUSH>
Aren't you happy to see us?
<PUSH>
You were well-known for
your strength back home,
<PUSH>
but perhaps becoming a
Wizard has made you lose
your edge!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Grrr...!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Virgo>
Kyahahahaha!!
Are you scared!?
<PUSH>
I can't believe it, but
Omega-Xis is scared of us!
<PUSH>
Take a look, Corvus!
He's shaking in his boots!
<PUSH>
Kyahahahaha!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Wolf.Woods>
Do you remember back home
when you would try to fight
<PUSH>
with us and we would just
pound you into the ground!?
<PUSH>
You must have gotten at
least a tiny bit stronger
since then, right!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Enough of this!!!
