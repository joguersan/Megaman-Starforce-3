Are you going to swim too,
Ms. Tia?

<Bud>
If we're changing into our
bathing suits, then...
<PUSH>
I have to do "that"...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
B-Bud!
<PUSH>
You don't mean...!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
You're really going to do
that...!?

<(Queen)Tia>
{13}{EC}...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
What the heck is "that"?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
"That" is a skill that only
boys can perform.
"That" is the hidden art of...
<PUSH>
"Boxers Off!"

{13}{EC}...!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Boxers Off?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
It's a skill that has been
passed down for generations,
<PUSH>
and is a forbidden changing
style that has become legend.
<PUSH>
First, you take off your
pants, then put your bathing
suit on over your boxers.
<PUSH>
Then, you take off your
boxers from underneath
your swim trunks.
<PUSH>
Thus you have successfully
changed without ever getting
naked!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
What!?
Is that possible!?
<PUSH>
And why is it forbidden?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Jack...
<PUSH>
In attempting to perform
this skill, one takes a great
risk...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
To take off your boxers
that are underneath your
swim trunks, you must pull
<PUSH>
down your boxers and take
out each leg, one by one...
<PUSH>
And of course, when you go
to do that...!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
That's too dangerous...
Your boxers could...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Exactly. If you do it wrong,
your waistband will rip and
make the worst noise...
<PUSH>
And in the worst case...!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
No, Geo!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Bud!?
<PUSH>

<Bud>
Don't go any further{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
You're right...
I'm sorry, it's too graphic...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Well, either way...
It looks like I got myself
caught up in something big...

Are you guys too nervous

I'm willing to accept the risk.

We might as well try...
