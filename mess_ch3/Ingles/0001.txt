<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King>
The red shooting star that
will grant our wishes...
<PUSH>
It is shining beautifully
tonight, as usual...
<PUSH>
Soon enough, it will grant
myself and my organization,
Dealer, with great power...
<PUSH>
Don't you agree, Heartless?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
It will be just as you
say, Mr. King.

[SENTENCE NUMBER 4]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Once my genius intellect
is united with enough
Crimson, that red shooting
<PUSH>
star, Meteor G, will do as
we please...
<PUSH>
And then the people of
this planet will kneel down
before Dealer.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
There will be no one willing
to defy your wishes once
you explain to them what
<PUSH>
would happen if Meteor G
were to strike the Earth.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Even humans, as foolish as
they are, will remain silent.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
And you already receive
countless e-mails from
<PUSH>
children, expressing their
gratitude to you.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Hahaha...
I am quite pleased.
<PUSH>
All of my plans are moving
along smoothly...
<PUSH>
No one has the slightest
doubt about me...

And I've acquired an
ancient power...
<PUSH>
Hahaha...
<PUSH>
The moment of judgment
is close...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Boooring...
<PUSH>
What I really want to hear
is you telling me I'm allowed
to go take out Mega Man.

<Mr.King-2>
Well, well.
Aren't we in a foul mood?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Pfft!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Heartless>
Settle down, Jack.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Joker>
You are being quite rude
to Mr. King...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

Watch your mouth, man.

{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Investigating Mega Man is
just a waste of time.
<PUSH>
So just let us go and
fight him already.
<PUSH>
We can take him out while
he's not expecting it.
If he discovers our plans...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
{13}{EC}...

I apologize for Jack's
rudeness, Mr. King...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Hmph...
Jack...
<PUSH>
Has all the time you've
spent at that school with
<PUSH>
kids your age made you
weak?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
What did you just say!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
My plans are perfect.
<PUSH>
As long as you keep your
mouth shut, there won't be
any problems.
<PUSH>
And once I have that
shooting star in my hands,
<PUSH>
every worthless human will
kneel down before Dealer.
<PUSH>
Yes... Humans are indeed
weak, brittle, and foolish
creatures.
<PUSH>
Which is why they are always
in such a rush to get new
<PUSH>
"Brothers" and create new
"Purposes" with them.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King-2>
Humans need me to rule
over them...
<PUSH>
I will give this planet new
life...
<PUSH>
I will show them the true
reason to live...
<PUSH>
All foolish humans will be
under Dealer's control once
<PUSH>
I have Meteor G in my
hands...
