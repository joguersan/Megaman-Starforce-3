Should a star like you be
eating so much...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sonia>
*chomp, chomp*
<PUSH>
You don't have to worry
about my weight!

I never gain weight, no

<Geo>
Prez...?
Why are you holding my hand?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Silly, Geo...
<PUSH>
You looked a little down while
looking at the ocean...
<PUSH>
It's so beautiful and peaceful,
but it's pretty scary to
think about falling in...
<PUSH>
Is that what's troubling
you?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
You sure can read me well.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Brothers understand each
other better than anyone.
<PUSH>
But even if I couldn't read
you, it would be my duty as
<PUSH>
class president to hold your
hand for safety's sake.
<PUSH>
You better appreciate me.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
O-Of course I do...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
I still can't believe it.
<PUSH>
That a normal kid like you
is really Mega Man...
<PUSH>
If people found out, I bet
that they'd be so let down.
<PUSH>
I mean...
I was like that once, too.

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
You're so brave and cool
when you're Mega Man.
<PUSH>
It's just that a totally
normal guy like you...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Ahaha...
<PUSH>
Forgive me. It's a shame
that your beloved hero is
a guy like me...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Don't say that...
<PUSH>
If I compare you now to
when I first met you...
<PUSH>
You've{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} How do you say it{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}?{14}{E1}
You've really grown up.
<PUSH>
You're more confident and
proud. More like Mega Man!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I'm doing my best.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
I know...
<PUSH>
I really want to express my
gratitude to you.
<PUSH>
Thank you, Geo...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Did I do something?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
My handkerchief...
My mother gave it to me, so
it's very special.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I see...
<PUSH>
Ever since that time, have
you been getting along with
your parents?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Of course.
<PUSH>
We had a lot of differences
and it all eventually came to
a climax, but...
<PUSH>
Now we're a happy family.
<PUSH>
Now that I think of it...
That's all thanks to Mega
Man, as well.
<PUSH>
You saved me when those
bad aliens used my emotions
to control me.
<PUSH>
...When I think about it, it
seems that I'm always being
saved...
<PUSH>
If only I could fight right
beside you, like Sonia does.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
When my dad disappeared...
<PUSH>
It was you that got me to
stop staying cooped up in
my house and go to school.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
{13}{EC}...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
And you gave me the
courage to keep fighting
<PUSH>
when I lost my confidence
in battle...
<PUSH>
If I had never met you...
<PUSH>
I think that I would have
given up on being Mega Man
a long time ago.
<PUSH>
You're already fighting along
side me, Prez.
<PUSH>
Much more than you realize...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
G-Geo, I never knew you had
it in you to say something
in such a sweet way.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I'm just saying what I feel...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
I understand!
<PUSH>
So you mean that you'll be
happy to have me continue
fighting along side you!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yeah. Please never stop.
<PUSH>
It looks...
It looks like another fight
may be starting...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
.{13}{E1}.{13}{E1}.{13}{E1}Really?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Ace told me that there's a
great disaster coming...
<PUSH>
And also that someday he
will have to borrow Sonia
and my powers...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
You'll fight just because he
told you to?
<PUSH>
It could be a lie.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Wizards have been going out
of control a lot, lately...
<PUSH>
And it appears that someone
is using Noise Cards to make
them go out of control.
<PUSH>
With the rocket incident
and the concert incident...
<PUSH>
Even though they weren't
successful, they still caused
a lot of problems.
<PUSH>
I don't know what these
people are up to, but I
can't ignore what's happening.
<PUSH>
If it will stop these people,
then I'm willing to fight.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
I see...
<PUSH>
If that's the case, then I'll
fight along side you in my
own way.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Prez...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Geo, we're Brothers.
<PUSH>
We'll always be connected,
no matter how terrible of a
fight you are in.
<PUSH>
Never forget that...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Thank you, Prez.
<PUSH>
Let's fight together!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
You can count on me!!
