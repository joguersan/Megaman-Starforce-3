<Dread.Joker>
Hah hah hah...
That is correct...
<PUSH>
The truth is that...
<PUSH>
I am the most powerful
Battle Wizard ever created...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
W-Wizard!?
<PUSH>
You're a Wizard...!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dread.Joker>
And this form is the
manifestation of the power
of the red shooting star...
<PUSH>
Only he who accesses the
"Meteor Server" can acquire
this ultimate form of power!!

Are you watching, Acid?
Can you hear me, Brother!?

This is also your true form!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
What are you saying!?
<PUSH>
Joker...
How are you and Acid
connected?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dread.Joker>
We were both born from
the same program.
<PUSH>
The program was designed to
create Wizards that can
adapt to any level of Noise!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Adapt to Noise...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Are you talking about
Noise Changing then!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dread.Joker>
Hah hah hah...
<PUSH>
I suppose you could call it
that! You have also acquired
the same ability!
<PUSH>
However!!
<PUSH>
You are but a low-grade
imitation...
<PUSH>
You are only able to draw
on but a scarce amount of
the Meteor Server's power!
<PUSH>
Pathetic!!
Truly pathetic!
<PUSH>
Leave it to a human to be
scared of the infinite power
that Noise can bring them!
<PUSH>
Mega Man...
<PUSH>
That program that you use
is actually something that
was stolen from us.
<PUSH>
But it's really just a tiny
fragment of its true power!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I have no clue what...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dread.Joker>
While it was you humans who
gave us our power...
<PUSH>
Our reason for living...
<PUSH>
You also felt that we were
too powerful, and mercilessly
stole our power from us!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dread.Joker>
Can you possibly understand!?
<PUSH>
How do you think it feels to
have your reason for living
taken away from you!?
<PUSH>
But then, Mr. King gave me
a new reason to live!
<PUSH>
As Mr. King's Wizard, I have
been able to return myself
to my original and true form!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Bah!!
A reason to live!?
<PUSH>
Even a windbag like you could
find that all by yourself!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dread.Joker>
What does that mean!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I'm saying I don't understand
all this "given" and "stolen"
stuff you keep talking about!!
<PUSH>
Real Wizards don't whine
on and on about stuff like
that!
<PUSH>
Do you want to be a
human or something!?

Wizard, human, or something
else completely!?

My pleasure!
That's a favor I can do.

As long as you're asking for
a can of butt whoopin'!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Joker!!
<PUSH>
I think you have bigger
things to worry about, other
than what you are!

Because what you're doing
is ruining billions of lives!

Including all of the people
that are special to me!
