You have a call!

It's from Dr. Goodall!

Oh! OK.

<Geo-2>
Good morning, Dr. Goodall.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Good morning, Geo.
<PUSH>
Hee hee.{15}{E1}
You look like you got some
good sleeping in!
<PUSH>
Oh, to be young again...
<PUSH>
I find that the older you
get, the earlier you wake up.
<PUSH>
You just can't sleep as much
as when you were young.
<PUSH>
You know!
<PUSH>
I used to sleep so much
when I was a young girl!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Umm...{15}{E1} Umm...{15}{E1} Dr. Goodall...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
{15}{E1}...Oh, yes indeed.
<PUSH>
That's enough chit-chat, for
the time being.
<PUSH>
I'm sorry I had to wake you
up, but I have an assignment
for you.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
No problem!
What's the assignment?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
I want you to investigate
the following three areas.
<PUSH>
<Echo.Ridge> Elementary...
<PUSH>
<Spica.Mall>...
<PUSH>
and <Studi.WBG>...
<PUSH>
You should be able to find
Noise Waves there.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Noise Waves!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Yes.
<PUSH>
It seems that Dealer uses
Noise Waves to travel to
and from different places.
<PUSH>
If you went and talked to
the denizens of the Noise
Waves...
<PUSH>
You might be able to track
that child...
<PUSH>
Joker...
<PUSH>
Tracking him should lead you
to Dealer's base.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
So...
You're telling us to go mine
for data!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
That's right, Meggers!
<PUSH>
You are such a smart little
guy, aren't you?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Bah! You'd have to be
pretty dumb to not
understand what you meant!

{13}{EC}(That reminds me. We
{13}{EC} watched that wave crime

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Hee hee. Silly Meggers.
<PUSH>
Well now, let's go over what
happened yesterday.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
The first incident was at
Geo's school.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Wizards went out of control
and terrorized the front
entrance area.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
That was really strange,
wasn't it!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Following that, three out of
control Wizards attacked
<Spica.Mall>.
<PUSH>
The entrances to Noise
Waves are in the Real World,
<PUSH>
so make sure to check out
all suspicious places in the
three areas for them.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
The final area to have an
incident was <Studi.WBG>.
<PUSH>
That's where Joker showed
up!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
The Noise in that area is
a little different, or should I
say special...
<PUSH>
You should not go there
until after you've checked
<PUSH>
out Echo Ridge Elementary
and <Spica.Mall>.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
OK, we got it!
You can count on us to
catch those bad guys!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Hee hee!
I'm counting on you, Meggers.
<PUSH>
Well then, Geo.
<PUSH>
Since Noise Waves are very
dangerous areas, this is
something only you can do...
<PUSH>
Do your best, and make
sure to stay safe, OK?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yes, ma'am!
Over and out!
<PUSH>

Alright, let's go investigate!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Data mining!
It's called data mining!
<PUSH>
Hehehe.
I'm going to be the best
Wizard detective ever!
<PUSH>
You're going to let me help
out at the scene, right?
<PUSH>
If you need any help, just
talk to me!
<PUSH>
Got it, Detective Stelar!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Detective Stelar?
<PUSH>
Hmm, that doesn't sound half
bad...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
It's time, Detective Stelar!
The scene of the crime is
calling us!!
