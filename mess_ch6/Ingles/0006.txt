1This is a message for all
active members of the
Satella Police.
<PUSH>
The out of control Wizards
have caused a great deal of
damage to Electopia.
<PUSH>
All out of control Wizards
must be stopped in order to
prevent further damage!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
It really is a country-wide
incident!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Nice!
The more bad guys, the more
butt we get to kick!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

areas of insurrection within

<Geo>
Three areas!?
We better get moving!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Weird...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
What is it, Mega?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
It looks like you've given up
on always whining about how
<PUSH>
you don't like battling and
how you don't want to stand
out!
<PUSH>
Have you finally realized how
fun battling is!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
No, that's not it.
<PUSH>
I still don't like battling, and
I don't want to stand out.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
So what is it then?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I don't really understand it
completely, myself...
<PUSH>
But when I see Ace doing
what he does, it makes me
<PUSH>
feel like I need to be doing
the same thing.
<PUSH>
He's sacrificing his body,
and risking his life, so that
<PUSH>
he can fight for everyone's
peace and safety.
<PUSH>
And he fights to protect the
people that he loves.
<PUSH>
I want to protect the
people that I love, too!
<PUSH>
And I'm willing to fight, if
that's what it takes!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>
Humans really are complicated
creatures, aren't they?
<PUSH>
You have people in this
world who want to protect
<PUSH>
the world, but then there
are others in this world who
just want to see it burn.
<PUSH>
I just get so angry when I
think about the people who
want to ruin everything!
<PUSH>
We are totally going to kick
their sorry butts!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Haha!
You never change, Mega!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
{13}{EC}???
<PUSH>
I-I guess.
<PUSH>
I guess it's hard for
someone who's awesome to
stop being awesome!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Haha, I suppose you're right!
<PUSH>
