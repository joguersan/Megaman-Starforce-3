<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
We better get a hold of the
Satella Police, ASAP!
<PUSH>
{15}{E1}...Huh?
<PUSH>
I'm not getting an EM wave
signal...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I just noticed that!
<PUSH>
This place seems to handle
EM waves in its own peculiar
way.
<PUSH>
Only specific EM waves can
enter or leave this place!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
I see...
This place must be hidden
somehow.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Even searching for this
place with EM waves wouldn't
work.
<PUSH>
The only thing that would
work is the naked eye.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Either way, we still need
to get in touch with the
Satella Police!
<PUSH>
