<Megaman> The Wave Road is back together again! 
I wonder where it leads to...? 
<Mega> What do you want to do? Do you want to go back and report to everyone? 
<Megaman> {13}{EC}... 
{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}No, we're moving on. 
There's nothing more important than that at the moment! 
<Mega> Haha, that's my boy! 
Sweet! It looks like we're going to get that chance to whoop some Dealer butt! 
<Megaman> No doubt! Let's rock, Mega!
