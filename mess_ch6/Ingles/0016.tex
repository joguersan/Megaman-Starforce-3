<Geo-2> This is Dealer's base...? 
<Mega> Looks like it. 
Check that out!! 
<Geo-2> {13}{EC}!! 
Yeah... I think we found it. 
This is definitely Dealer's base. 
<Geo-2> We better get a hold of the Satella Police, ASAP! 
{15}{E1}...Huh? 
I'm not getting an EM wave signal... 
<Mega> I just noticed that! 
This place seems to handle EM waves in its own peculiar way. 
Only specific EM waves can enter or leave this place! 
<Geo-2> I see... This place must be hidden somehow. 
<Mega> Even searching for this place with EM waves wouldn't work. 
The only thing that would work is the naked eye. 
<Geo-2> Either way, we still need to get in touch with the Satella Police! 
<Geo-2> If we just go somewhere where EM waves can get through, for a bit... 
<Geo-2> Sweet, I got a hold of them. 
While we're waiting let's investigate more.
