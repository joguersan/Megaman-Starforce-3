<Game> At The Same Time... 
<Mr.King-2> We have destroyed all of the WAZA HQs of the world, 
and now we are also able to control Meteor G! 
However...!

of Crimson in order to completely control it! 
I never would have imagined Meteor G being this gigantic! 
We definitely need to get our hands on some more Crimson, don't we, Heartless? 
<Heartless> Jack and Queen Tia were in charge of the Crimson collection... 
Do you plan on rescuing them?

<Joker> I have an idea...
