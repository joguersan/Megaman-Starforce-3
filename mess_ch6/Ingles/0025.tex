<Mega> This must be the control panel for the power core! 
<Megaman> And that's...{16}{E1} The symbol of Mu! 
Just like Solo said... 
Dealer is using the power of Mu for its own ends! 
<Mega> Well, kid. There's only one thing to do then. 
And that's to tear this thing to pieces, so it never works again! 
<Megaman> Yeah! 
<Megaman> {13}{EC}!? 
<Mega> Argh! 
<Megaman> Ungh... 
We... We should have stayed alert!! 
<Mega> Umph... 
My power is being drained out of me... 
Or is it dissipating? 
<Megaman> Our EM Wave Change is... 
<Mega> {13}{EC}(Not good!!) 
{13}{EC}(If you're still in a Cyber {13}{EC} Core when you change {13}{EC} back into a human...) 
{13}{EC}(I don't even want to know!) 
<Mega> Kid! Trans out... Now! 
<Megaman> I-I can't{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} 
I don't have the strength... 
<Game> ...{16}{E1} I've found your toy, Dealer... 
What a pitiful device! 
{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}Hmph! 
<Megaman> I{16}{E1}-I can move... 
<Mega> Hey, kid! Quit messin' around!! 
{11}{E2}{00}{00} 
<Mega> I have no clue what just happened, but let's hit this thing fast and hard!! 
<Megaman> {13}{EC}!! 
Deal! 
<Megaman> Whoa! 
That was close. 
<Mega> At least this thing won't be functioning any time soon! 
We've got no other reason to be here, kid... Time to trans out! 
<Megaman> Yeah.
