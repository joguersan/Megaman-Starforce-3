As far as Acid goes...

I've reinstalled his main
program, and he is in the
middle of restarting, now.
<PUSH>
Arthur is...

Not doing well.

Deep sections of his
consciousness were torn to

pieces by Acid when he was
out of control...

him to his physical limits,

That is true.

I suppose that it's best for
you to know.

Dr. Goodall...

Doc... I'm sorry.

But, I can't just sit around

Dealer is still going ahead
with their plans.

Dealer is getting closer to
their goal of taking over the
world...

that chance!

S-So...
I can't just stand around...

4...Are we not able to protect
the world without sending
that young boy into danger?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
I see things differently.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4{13}{EC}!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Wanting to protect the world
has nothing to do with being
an adult or a child.
<PUSH>
In fact, children surely want
to do so based on more
<PUSH>
pure and innocent beliefs
and motives.
<PUSH>
That young boy is doing all
he possibly can to protect
the planet...
<PUSH>
But I bet he doesn't even
realize how much he has
already done for all of us.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4When this is all over, we will
have to make sure he does.
<PUSH>

the plan.

Isn't that right, Dr. Goodall?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
You said it.
