<Megaman> That's Crimson... 
<Megaman> I wonder where that Crimson went to? 
<Mega> No clue... 
Do you want to go chase it? 
<Megaman> That's not a bad idea! 
{15}{E1}...But, it's already too late... 
<Game> *beep* 
<Megaman> Ah, a phone call... 
<Megaman> It's the Satella Police! 
0Mega Man! We have a situation here! 
Wizards are going out of control all over Electopia! 
<Megaman> What!? 
Is Dealer behind it!? 
0That hasn't been confirmed. 
However, no Noise cards have been located. 
It appears that an unusual amount of Noise could be the cause of the problem... 
At the moment, Satella Police officers are on their way 
to various locations in order to stop the Wizards! 
We would be grateful to have a member of the Commandos lend a hand! 
Will you please assist us? 
<Megaman> Of course!{15}{E1} Where would you like me to go? 
0We have a report that there is a Wizard acting strange at <Spica.Mall>. 
<Megaman> <Spica.Mall>!? I'm on my way! 
0Thank you, Mega Man! 
We're counting on you! 
<Mega> So Wizards are going out of control again, huh? 
<Megaman> Looks like it... 
Electopia is on the verge of a crisis! 
<Mega> That's pretty crazy that so much of Electopia is being attacked all at once! 
<Megaman> We're in charge of defending <Spica.Mall>! 
Let's go, Mega!
