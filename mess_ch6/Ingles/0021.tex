<Mega> OK, kid! 
Let's go buck wild on this crazy machine! 
<Megaman> Definitely! 
<Megaman> Oh no, it's a trap! 
Ahh!! I can't move! 
<Mega> I can't believe this! 
What the heck are we going to do!? 
<Megaman> I don't know exactly... 
But we've got to get out of here, no matter what! 
U{16}{E1}-Uuuuumph!! 
<Game> Leave it to me! 
<Megaman> Sonia! 
<HarpNote> I'll be fine here by myself! 
You keep going, Geo! 
<Megaman> OK! 
Thanks for the save, Sonia! 
<HarpNote> Ungh! 
<Lyra> The Noise here is so intense! 
But those two seemed just fine... 
<HarpNote> I'm just glad we could help them without causing them anymore trouble... 
Geo would worry way too much, if he saw us like this. 
<HarpNote> Well... Let's get moving! 
<Lyra> You're the best, Sonia... 
You surprise me more and more, every day!
