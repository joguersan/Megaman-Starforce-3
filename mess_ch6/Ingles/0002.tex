<Game> Then... 
The next school day after Jack's attack on the school... 
<Geo-2> {13}{EC}(It looks like the {13}{EC} school is back to normal...) 
{13}{EC}(Jack and Ms. Tia{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} {13}{EC} they're both gone...) 
{13}{EC}(Why did it have {13}{EC} to be like this?) 
<Mega> Are you still all upset about them!? 
Act like a man! 
The fight with Dealer has only just begun! 
<Geo-2> Y-Yeah... 
<Mega> We're going to kick those Joker and King guys' butts! 
<Mega> Raaaooor! 
I can't wait to tear those two to pieces!! 
<Geo-2> You need to chill, Mega! 
The only thing you think about lately is fighting! 
<Mega> Grr! Humans are always over thinking things! 
And that always puts you into dangerous situations! 
<Geo-2> {13}{EC}...!! 
T{15}{E1}-That... That{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} could be true... 
B-But, I... 
<Hope(Mom)> Geeeo! Your friends are here! 
<Geo> OK!! 
<Geo-2> {13}{EC}(Let's just {13}{EC} get to school...) 
{13}{EC}(I don't know if {13}{EC} something is going {13}{EC} to happen, but...) 
{13}{EC}(But no {13}{EC} matter what, I'll...)
