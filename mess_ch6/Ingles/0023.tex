<Megaman> ...It doesn't look like we can stop it or turn it off. 
We'll have to destroy it. 
{99}{00}Gwaaaaaa!! 
<Megaman> An ambush! 
<Mega> This isn't good... 
It could take way too long to finish off all of these guys! 
<Megaman> Yeah... 
But do we have any other choice? 
<Game> Stop right there! 
{A8}{00}We'll handle these guys for you. 
Get yourself to the control panel! 
Ungh... Argh... 
<Megaman> Y-You can't!! 
The Noise here is too much for you! 
If you don't leave ASAP you'll- 
{A8}{00}Don't worry about us! 
We won't go out of control. 
It's not possible for us to do the terrible things that out of control Wizards do. 
We have a self-destruct program for that. 
<Megaman> Self...{16}{E1} Self-destruct!? 
{A8}{00}Ungh! 
Th-The Noise here really is unbelievably strong. 
I've already hit my time limit! 
<Megaman> {13}{EC}!! 
{A8}{00}It was fun while it lasted, Mega Man!! 
{A8}{00}We are the proud and brave Satella Police! 
{A8}{00}For peace and justice! 
{A8}{00}For the bright future of the people of this world!! 
<Megaman> N-Noooooo!! 
No... 
Noooooo!! 
<Megaman> Everyone... 
<Mega> Come on, kid... 
They were just fulfilling their Purpose, weren't they? 
<Megaman> ...Good point.
