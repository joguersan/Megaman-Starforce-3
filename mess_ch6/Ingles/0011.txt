0Everyone is here.
<PUSH>
Whenever you are ready,
Chief.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4Then we'll begin immediately.
<PUSH>
Let's hear from the
research team first.
<PUSH>
Aaron Boreal has some
findings to report.

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
We've come upon some new
discoveries regarding
Crimson.
<PUSH>
Even though Crimson is a
body of crystallized Noise,
<PUSH>
no Noise is released from
Crimson whatsoever.
<PUSH>
Which means that Crimson
has a Noise absorbing nature.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
It absorbs Noise...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
0That means that it could
be useful to us, right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Exactly...
<PUSH>
It could quite well prove to
be a beneficial item for us.
<PUSH>
However, if Dealer were to
make use of it, they could
<PUSH>
easily turn it into a
terrifying weapon.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
When Crimson reaches
capacity for the amount of
Noise that it can hold...
<PUSH>
It emits a huge quantity of
dense Noise.
<PUSH>
The amount of Noise that is
emitted is actually dozens
<PUSH>
of times the amount that
was absorbed.
<PUSH>
The reason that Meteor G
is being pulled toward Earth
may be the fact that the
<PUSH>
Noise level has been on the
rise due to Crimson emitting
so much Noise.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Hmm...
Crimson kind of seems like
a bomb, doesn't it?
<PUSH>
I guess...
More like a Noise bomb, huh?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
There are other ways to
use Crimson than as
a bomb, Omega-Xis.
<PUSH>
I believe that Crimson was
used as energy to make
<PUSH>
Noise clusters, like the ones
you saw at your school.
<PUSH>
If applied correctly, we could
freely control the output of
Noise with Crimson.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
{13}{EC}...!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-2>
Control...
Noise?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
3To think that Crimson would
have such uses...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
{13}{EC}...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
...Heehee!
<PUSH>
Go on, Aaron.
You can tell us.
<PUSH>
You look like you've found
something else out, too.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
What!?{15}{E1} Oh...
That's true, Doctor...
<PUSH>
Upon researching exactly
how the Noise that's on the
planet is attracting Meteor
<PUSH>
G, I found that there is
"strange Noise" being emitted
from Meteor G itself.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4What kind of Noise could
that be exactly?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
I'm sorry, but I haven't
discovered that yet...
<PUSH>
However...
<PUSH>
When I first noticed the
strange Noise, it was as if I
heard Meteor G's "voice".
<PUSH>
Whether it is trying to say
something... Or call someone...
Or answer someone...
<PUSH>
I just don't know.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dr.Goodall>
Heehee!
That could prove to be a
very interesting lead!
<PUSH>
We must look into that voice.
<PUSH>
Would you be so kind as to
let this old lady help you
out, Aaron?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Boreal>
Of course!
<PUSH>
Well, that concludes my
report.

<NEW-DIALOG>
4Thank you, Boreal.
<PUSH>
Next up, we will discuss the
incidents of out of control
Wizards around the country.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
0Yes, sir!
<PUSH>
It is believed that the cause
of the incidents was the high
Noise levels in those areas.
<PUSH>
We still have not discovered
any Noise Cards, program
viruses, or anything else
<PUSH>
that would place Dealer as
the culprit.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
...Still...
It has to be their doing.
<PUSH>
Even without evidence it's
clear.
<PUSH>
There's no one else that
would or could pull off such
a large-scale event.

<NEW-DIALOG>
1B-But...
<PUSH>
How could they cause so
many Wizards at once to-
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
With Crimson.
<PUSH>
They must have found out
that Noise can be controlled
with Crimson.
<PUSH>
They just figured it out way
before we did.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
4And now they've already
learned how to use it as a
weapon.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
The situation could get
even worse...
<PUSH>
King doesn't just want to
control ordinary Noise...
<PUSH>
He wants to control a
gigantic cluster of Noise...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
0A gigantic cluster of it!?
W-What do you mean!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Isn't it fairly obvious?
<PUSH>
I mean that ominous ball in
the sky that's causing people
to lose sleep at night.

...The red star that is falling
from the heavens upon us.

2Is that...
Could that really be true...!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid>
Actually, Dealer has already
taken some control of
Meteor G.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
Their whole reasoning behind
making Wizards go out of
<PUSH>
control is to collect the
Crimson that is emitted.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
0W-Wait a second...!
<PUSH>
When we stop an out of
control Wizard, Crimson is
released...
<PUSH>
And then Dealer collects the
Crimson.
<PUSH>
So then why are we risking
our lives across the country
to fight the Wizards!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
It looks like...
<PUSH>
...It's to help Dealer out.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
1Th-That can't be...!
<PUSH>

<Ace>
Yet, if we don't stop the
out of control Wizards, then

many people will be hurt or
worse.

We are doing the right thing.
