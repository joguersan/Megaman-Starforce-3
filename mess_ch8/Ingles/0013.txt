<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sirius>
Gahaha...
<PUSH>
Welcome, Mega Man.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
So you're Sirius!{15}{E1}
How dare you...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sirius>
It has been a long time
since I last had a guest.
<PUSH>
Oh, about... 100 years or so.{15}{E1}
Yes, that sounds right.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Hey! Stop talking to yourself
and pay attention for once!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sirius>
...
<PUSH>
I don't need that rude EM
being for my collection.
<PUSH>
Mega Man will look much
better on my shelf.
<PUSH>
So, Mega Man...
Stand still, please. It's time
to remove your will.
<PUSH>
Then we'll get you started
battling with all sorts of fun
EM beings...{16}{E1}
<PUSH>
Your battles are always so
enjoyable to watch!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
He wants to make us his
toys...
<PUSH>
This guy... {15}{E1}is insane.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I'm not letting you get
anywhere near me!
<PUSH>
I'll make you pay for what
you have done, Sirius!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sirius>
Oh! {14}{E1}Fantastic!{15}{E1}
I just thought of something!
<PUSH>
Let's set Planet FM as your
first battle stage!
<PUSH>
Do me a favor and go as
"buck wild" as you like.
<PUSH>
I was hoping to enjoy
watching everyone on the
planet panic for a bit...
<PUSH>
But I suppose destroying it
outright would be fun too.
<PUSH>
There are so many planets
for me to play with.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Peoples lives... Planets...
They aren't toys for you to
play with.
<PUSH>
Have you even considered
the pain you are putting all
<PUSH>
those people down there
through?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sirius>
Everything here will cease to
exist.
<PUSH>
A black hole has no need
for such things as emotions.
<PUSH>
You should... be happy.
<PUSH>
You will live forever within
the darkness.
<PUSH>
You will be mine.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I wouldn't call that living!
<PUSH>
I'd rather not exist!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sirius>
.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}I see.
Do you think that you might
change your mind?
<PUSH>
Stopping you without causing
you any injury would be a
bit of a nuisance for me.
<PUSH>
It will be hard for us to
play together with you
injured.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Do you ever shut up!?
You don't stand a chance
against us!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Sirius>
I have full control over
all aspects of this server.
<PUSH>
You do realize that, right?
<PUSH>
That gives you absolutely no
chance of stopping me.
<PUSH>
.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}But I suppose some children
need to be punished in order
to learn their lesson.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Here he comes, kid!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I'm ready!
This fight...{16}{E1}
Is ours!!
<PUSH>
Last Battle!{14}{E1}
Ride On!!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>
