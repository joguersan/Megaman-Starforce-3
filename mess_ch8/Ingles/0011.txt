<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Ace, too, huh?
But you're not the Ace that
I know.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid.Ace>
I am Acid Ace R.
<PUSH>
I was created by Sirius, and
gifted with an almost infinite
<PUSH>
amount of power by this
server.
<PUSH>
You must be quite the
warrior to have defeated
all of the other "R"s.
<PUSH>
But you will not be able to
do the same to us!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
"Us"...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
No way...
Is he here, too!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
Why yes I am.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 2]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dread.Joker>
I am Dread Joker R!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Interesting...
<PUSH>
So even in these "R"
forms, you guys still come
in a two-pack, huh?
<PUSH>
But where's the sibling
rivalry that we all love?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dread.Joker>
Fighting amongst ourselves
would be ridiculous...
<PUSH>
Our power increases greatly
when we work together.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid.Ace>
Well said.
<PUSH>
I mean, Sirius did trust us
to protect the final path to
where he is!
<PUSH>
We're pretty awesome!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
*sigh*
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Dread.Joker>
I'll do the honors first.
If you don't mind, Acid Ace.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Acid.Ace>
No worries, Jokey.
I'll watch from the sidelines.
<PUSH>
If anything goes wrong, I'll
be right there to help.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
It looks like we have to
deal with both of these
losers in a row...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
This is going to be one
tough battle...
<PUSH>
But we have no choice!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>
