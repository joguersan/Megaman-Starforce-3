<Megaman> There's a door blocking the path... 
<Mega> We can't get through that thing! 
<Megaman> I wonder why someone set it up here? 
{80}{00}I CAN TELL YOU... 
{80}{00}A BIG GUY WITH A BLUE ARM AND A RED ARM... 
HE LOCKED THE DOOR. 
<Mega> A guy with a blue arm and a red arm... Could it be Spade Magnes? 
<Megaman> Hmm... The last I heard, he was still in space. 
{80}{00}HE WENT SOMEWHERE VIA THAT DEVICE. 
<Megaman> Transmission Log: Spade Magnes R... Natl WAZA HQ Cyber Core... 
<Mega> Heh! See, it was Spade Magnes! 
<Megaman> But, what does "R" mean? 
<Mega> I have no clue, but we'll find out when we see him! 
If we don't find him, we won't be able move ahead. 
<Megaman> Natl WAZA HQ Cyber Core... That's not very clear. 
<Mega> We'll just have to search the whole place once we get there. This'll do for now. 
<Megaman> OK! Let's go back for now! 
<Mega> So a mysterious EM being transmitted itself from a Noise Wave to WAZA, huh? 
That sounds suspicious... And like fun!
