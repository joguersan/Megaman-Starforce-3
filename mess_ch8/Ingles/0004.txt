[SENTENCE NUMBER 1]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Whoa... Where are we?
<PUSH>
There're stars everywhere...
I've never seen a place like
this before.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I'm sensing that we've
left the solar system, and
<PUSH>
are actually in the center of
our galaxy.
<PUSH>
Your scientists would call
it "deep space".
<PUSH>
Strangely enough, something
here seems familiar to me.
<PUSH>
...Huh?
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 2]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I remember now!
<PUSH>
This is where Kelvin and his
team built the communications
Wave Road to <Pianeta.FM-color>!
<PUSH>
This EM wave tower has
seen better days, but there
is no doubt about it.
<PUSH>
This Wave Road leads to
Planet FM!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
...Mega! That's terrible!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Huh? What is?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Think about it.
<PUSH>
We got here by following the
path the "R" guys traveled...
<PUSH>
That means that the planet
that they and their leader
are invading is Planet FM...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
So you've finally made it
this far...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
!!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 3]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Whoever is speaking has a
very strong presence, kid!
<PUSH>
It could be an "R" guy...
<PUSH>
Or maybe their leader!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 4]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
You guys!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
You're the <3.Saggi.di.AM-color>!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{81}{00}Omega-Xis...
We don't appreciate you
treating us like enemies.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I can't help it when you look
like you guys do!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{82}{00}Moving on...
Geo Stelar... Mega Man...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Yes?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{83}{00}It's just as you guessed.
<PUSH>
Planet FM is currently on
the brink of destruction.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{81}{00}Your Brother, <Cepheus-color>
the FM King, is fighting for
<PUSH>
his life along with the other
FM-ians.
<PUSH>
Things are not looking good.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Cepheus...
<PUSH>
So that means that the
Astro Hertz who came to
Earth was sent to find us...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
And you guys must be on
your way to help, right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{82}{00}If we could help, we would
of course do so...
<PUSH>
However, the enemy has
placed an EM barrier around
the whole planet.
<PUSH>
We can't get through to
join the battle.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I can't believe that there's
a barrier that the 3 Sages
of <Pianeta.AM-color> can't get past.
<PUSH>
Do you know who the
leader of those "R" guys is?
<PUSH>
Please tell us if you do!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{83}{00}His name is "Sirius".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
"Sirius"...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{83}{00}The data on him is very
scarce.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
We heard something about
him wanting to destroy
everything...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{81}{00}Yes...
<PUSH>
Sirius has the ability to
control black holes.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Black holes!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{82}{00}Any planet that is targeted
by Sirius will be swallowed up
<PUSH>
by a black hole, completely
disappearing from existence.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
A black hole isn't something
that is normally controllable,
is it?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{83}{00}No, however, Sirius is capable
of doing so. We have no idea
how he does it though.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
What can we do to stop
a black hole?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{83}{00}Unfortunately...
We have no idea.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I see...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{81}{00}Yet, there is one thing that
we can tell you.
<PUSH>
A very powerful EM being
that is not of the title "R"
was spotted near Planet FM.
<PUSH>
Currently, its whereabouts
are unknown.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{82}{00}It may have been carried
away by a Noise stream...
<PUSH>
That being was more
powerful than anything you
have fought in the past.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{83}{00}Be careful to not be taken
by surprise while focusing
on Sirius and the "R"s.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Thank you!
I'll be careful!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{81}{00}The FM King... Cepheus is
fighting, expecting you to
come to his aid.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I understand.
I'll do whatever it takes to
help a Brother!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{82}{00}Omega-Xis...
Geo Stelar is in your hands...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I already know that!
<PUSH>
And I'm going to go extra
buck wild to make up for
you guys not coming!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{83}{00}Good...
We are counting on you,
Mega Man...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 5]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
So this guy can control
black holes, huh?
<PUSH>
We can't let a guy like that
get away!
<PUSH>
Come on, kid!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
OK!
We'll rescue you Cepheus...
And Planet FM!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>
