<Megaman> Where are we? 
<Mega> In some Noise Wave that I've never seen before. 
What's...? 
{7F}{00}Ungh... Umph... 
<Megaman> What's wrong? 
{7F}{00}Wh-Where am I? 
<Megaman> Well you're... Actually, we have no idea. 
{7F}{00}I see... 
I have a message that needs to get to Earth. 
It's an SOS from my home planet... 
Everyone and everything will soon be destroyed by him. He's so powerful... 
And that server of his.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{16}{E1} Ungh! 
<Mega> Hey! Snap out of it! 
{7F}{00}I-I can't go any further... 
Our only hope is our Brother on Earth. 
Our king told us that there is someone on Earth with the power to save us... 
Ungh... 
<Mega> Hey! Who's this "someone"!? 
And what planet are you from!? 
{7F}{00}I{14}{E1}-I'm... fr...om...{15}{E1} 
Umph... 
<Mega> Darn it... He croaked on us... 
<Megaman> It's sad, but... At least he was able to accomplish his mission. 
<Mega> Oh! Are you saying that... 
<Megaman> Yeah. 
<Megaman> Let's keep going. His planet must be linked to this Noise Wave. 
And his people are waiting for their Brother from Earth to save the day! 
<Mega> Sounds like fun! I don't know what the heck is going on... 
But I'm always ready to go buck wild on some bad guys!!
