<Apollo.Flame> {13}{EC}... 
<Megaman> You're... Apollo Flame! 
<Mega> I thought we deleted you back in the Alternate World? 
<Apollo.Flame> My data was saved in the Black Hole Server, then Sirius recovered me. 
Amazed by my great power, he requested that I help him. 
Following my moral code, I agreed to delete all who attempted to get past me! 
However... In the end, it will be I who shall reign supreme. 
<Mega> This guy could be trouble... Argh! 
<Megaman> Yeah, he was pretty tough the last time around... 
But... 
Apollo Flame! Answer me this! 
What is up ahead? 
<Apollo.Flame> Planet FM of course. And Sirius is in the middle of taking it over. 
<Megaman> Then I'm getting past you to save my Brother! 
<Apollo.Flame> Are you too stupid to understand? 
The laws of nature have brought you here to be deleted! 
All existence must follow the laws of nature! 
<Megaman> Well I always do things my own way! I walk my own path! 
<Apollo.Flame> I see that you do not understand how the galaxy works! 
You'll just have to see it with your own eyes! 
<Megaman> Let's do this, Mega! 
Wave Battle! Ride On!!
