<Megaman> Ace, too, huh? But you're not the Ace that I know. 
<Acid.Ace> I am Acid Ace R. 
I was created by Sirius, and gifted with an almost infinite 
amount of power by this server. 
You must be quite the warrior to have defeated all of the other "R"s. 
But you will not be able to do the same to us! 
<Megaman> "Us"...? 
<Mega> No way... Is he here, too!? 
<Game> Why yes I am. 
<Megaman> !! 
<Dread.Joker> I am Dread Joker R! 
<Mega> Interesting... 
So even in these "R" forms, you guys still come in a two-pack, huh? 
But where's the sibling rivalry that we all love? 
<Dread.Joker> Fighting amongst ourselves would be ridiculous... 
Our power increases greatly when we work together. 
<Acid.Ace> Well said. 
I mean, Sirius did trust us to protect the final path to where he is! 
We're pretty awesome! 
<Megaman> *sigh* 
<Dread.Joker> I'll do the honors first. If you don't mind, Acid Ace. 
<Acid.Ace> No worries, Jokey. I'll watch from the sidelines. 
If anything goes wrong, I'll be right there to help. 
<Mega> It looks like we have to deal with both of these losers in a row... 
<Megaman> This is going to be one tough battle... 
But we have no choice!
