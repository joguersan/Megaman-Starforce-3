<Spade-Magnes> Th-This isn't possible... 
I have the title of "R". I can't be beaten by the likes of you... 
But it doesn't matter. You will be deleted by one of the other "R"s eventually... 
And then this world will be destroyed! 
Everything will be wiped out by the darkness.{16}{E1} So why stick around!? 
Aaahhh!! 
<Megaman> Phew... 
That guy fought completely different than the real Spade Magnes. 
He mentioned others who have the "R" title. I wonder how many there are? 
<Mega> Good question. 
What should we do? He made it seem like they were targeting Earth. 
<Megaman> Yeah, but we have no clues to follow right now... Let's go back to the Noise Wave. 
I feel like we might bump into more of those "R" guys if we do that. 
<Mega> Looking for a fight is always more entertaining than just sitting and waiting for one. 
It's a good plan, kid! 
<Megaman> Oh snap! 
<Mega> What? 
<Megaman> I wonder if the Noise Wave door will open? 
<Mega> There's no need to worry about that! 
<Megaman> What do you mean? 
<Mega> I saw on TV that once a door to a Noise Wave is 
opened, it will never shut permanently again! 
<Megaman> Sweet! 
Let's get a move on then!
