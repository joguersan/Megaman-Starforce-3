[SENTENCE NUMBER 1]

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Spade-Magnes>
Th-This isn't possible...
<PUSH>
I have the title of "R".
I can't be beaten by the
likes of you...
<PUSH>
But it doesn't matter.
You will be deleted by one
of the other "R"s eventually...
<PUSH>
And then this world will be
destroyed!
<PUSH>
Everything will be wiped out
by the darkness.{16}{E1}
So why stick around!?
<PUSH>
Aaahhh!!

[SENTENCE NUMBER 2]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Phew...
<PUSH>
That guy fought completely
different than the real
Spade Magnes.
<PUSH>
He mentioned others who
have the "R" title. I wonder
how many there are?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Good question.
<PUSH>
What should we do?
He made it seem like they
were targeting Earth.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Yeah, but we have no clues
to follow right now... Let's go
back to the Noise Wave.
<PUSH>
I feel like we might bump into
more of those "R" guys if
we do that.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Looking for a fight is always
more entertaining than just
sitting and waiting for one.
<PUSH>
It's a good plan, kid!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Oh snap!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
What?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I wonder if the Noise Wave
door will open?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
There's no need to worry
about that!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
What do you mean?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I saw on TV that once a
door to a Noise Wave is
<PUSH>
opened, it will never shut
permanently again!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Sweet!
<PUSH>
Let's get a move on then!
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>
