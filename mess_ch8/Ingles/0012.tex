<Game> Gahaha... 
<Megaman> !! 
<Mega> Sirius!? 
<Game> I see that you've eliminated all of my "R"s... 
I guess there is nothing left for you to do but to come and visit me. 
<Mega> What, you too scared to come to us!? 
<Game> If you come to see me, then I'll add you to my collection. 
I'll put you right next to Planet FM. 
See you soon.

<Mega> That guy doesn't listen to a word we say... He's beginning to irritate me. 
<Megaman> Yeah, me too... Well... He hasn't left us with any other choice! 
We have to delete him! 
There's no other way! ...Right? 
<Mega> Heh. That's the Geo I like! 
<Megaman> Haha! 
Let's rock, Mega! 
<Mega> Ready when you are!
