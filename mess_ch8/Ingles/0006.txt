H-How could I lose twice?

Is the universe saying that
it would rather have Sirius
rule instead of me?

<Megaman>
We... won.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
That was a close one.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I don't want to compliment
him, but he sure was strong.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Yeah, I don't think that
there is anyone stronger
than that guy was.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
That may be true...
<PUSH>
But it was his pride that
made him such a difficult
pawn for me to control.

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
...Sirius!?

Gahaha...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Show yourself!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
Gahaha...
<PUSH>
Before that... I'd like to
congratulate you, Mega Man.
<PUSH>
I was very interested in
your profile data when I
found it in Meteor G.
<PUSH>
Its analysis of your abilities
was right on the mark.
<PUSH>
However...
The trials ahead will push
you to your limits.
<PUSH>
If you were to make it all
the way to me...
<PUSH>
I would be most impressed.
<PUSH>
And I would be thrilled to add
you to my collection.
<PUSH>
...But for now, adieu.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

Wait!
I said show yourself!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I bet that was Sirius...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Possibly.
<PUSH>
The way he talked made it
seem like he looks down on
everyone...
<PUSH>
That really ticks me off!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I wonder what someone who
talks about Apollo Flame
like that is like?
<PUSH>
