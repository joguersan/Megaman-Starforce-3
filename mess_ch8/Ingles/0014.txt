I must return to my people.

Everyone must be so happy
that their king is safe.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
Healing the people's hearts
will prove a more arduous
job than repairing the planet.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I know you can do it,
FM King.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
There isn't anyone who they
look up to more than you.

Hearing that from friends
is inspiring. Thank you.

between Earth and
Planet FM to a whole new
level!

What's wrong?

Sirius...
Was an EM being that could
control black holes...
<PUSH>
He was so powerful.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

it! I'll be there for you!
