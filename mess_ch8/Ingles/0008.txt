Mega!

Nice!
We found it!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Yeah!
That should be the entrance
to the Black Hole Server!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Sirius is most likely inside...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
We have him now!
<PUSH>
Here we go!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Rogue!
Why are you here!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
...I'm here for Sirius.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{B1}{00}Gzzzt...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I have no idea how you
even know about him, but
let's team up to get him!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
No...
<PUSH>
You are going to fight me...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
What? Why?{16}{E1} But I'm trying to
stop Sirius too.
<PUSH>
If we were to combine our
powers...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Hmph... Not that talk about
bonds, again...
<PUSH>
Maybe you'll understand once
you hear this.
<PUSH>
I'm waiting to stop Sirius...
{16}{E1}Two days from now.
<PUSH>
{13}{E2}{03}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Huh?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
That's too late, kid!
Planet FM will be destroyed
before then!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
What are you up to, Rogue?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
I'm going to take back the
Mu Metal that Sirius stole.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Why do you have to wait
two days to do that?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Because the Mu Metal has
been absorbed into Sirius.
<PUSH>
And it rises out of his body
in the shape of a crest, on
a cyclical basis.
<PUSH>
The current cycle will end
in two days...
<PUSH>
I'm going to defeat him, and
take back the Mu Metal.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
What happens if you delete
him before then?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Then the Mu Metal will be
lost forever along with him.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
That Mu Metal is very
important to you, isn't it?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Yes. It's something that I
must get back for myself...
<PUSH>
For my people...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
If the Mu Metal were fused
with the edge of the Laplace
Blade.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
...?
What would happen?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{B1}{00}Brzzzt...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Good point, Laplace.
<PUSH>
It's not necessary for you
to know.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Anyway...
As long as you try
to keep moving ahead...
<PUSH>
I will have to stop you.
<PUSH>
So, what do you think?
<PUSH>
Do you think you can beat
me to get to Sirius?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}

<NEW-DIALOG>

Planet FM or Mu...
Which one can be saved?

<Mega>
...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}Rogue...
<PUSH>
I'm going to defeat you...{14}{E1}
And honor my...{16}{E1}
Promise to Cepheus.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Hmph...
<PUSH>
It looks like you've learned
to make decisions like a man.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Words and feelings aren't
always enough to ensure
peace and safety.
<PUSH>
Sometimes you have to risk
your life to get them...
<PUSH>
I learned that from Dad,
Ace, and Mega...
<PUSH>
And even from you, Rogue.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Even from me...?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
You don't recognize or try
to form bonds with the
people of today.
<PUSH>
But you hold your bond
to Mu very dearly in your
heart.
<PUSH>
It doesn't matter what's in
your way, you will risk your
life to protect that bond.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Of course, people nowadays
don't understand about Mu,
<PUSH>
so you've been driven to
protect your bond by some
not so nice means...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Don't you dare act like you
understand me.
<PUSH>
I'm going to delete you
because it will be fun.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
{B1}{00}Dzzzt...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Shut up, Laplace.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}Rogue{15}{E1}... I see.
<PUSH>
There's no way that our
feelings about bonds will
ever coincide.
<PUSH>
But if we are both people
who truly respect our
bonds with others...
<PUSH>
Then we will both be willing
to fight to protect them.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Exactly...
<PUSH>
It would be ideal to protect
your own bonds without
harming anyone else's.
<PUSH>
But life is not that simple
and easy.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
That's why I must protect
my bond with Cepheus!
<PUSH>
I understand your situation,
Rogue. But Cepheus
<PUSH>
entrusted me with the
fate of his people!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Rogue>
Then let it begin...{15}{E1} Mega Man.
<PUSH>
This is...{15}{E1}
A fight for honor...
