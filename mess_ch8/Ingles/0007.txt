So...
Are we finally there?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Yeah.
Over there is Planet FM.
<PUSH>
And Sirius's Black Hole
Server...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
It's right on top of it!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
We have to get there ASAP!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Definitely.
This Wave Road should lead
to the server's entrance.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
Geo, my Brother.
You really came...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
That voice...!{15}{E1}
Is that you, Cepheus!?

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Cepheus! Are you OK!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Good to see you, FM King!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
Thank you very much for
coming all this way.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
It's not a problem.
<PUSH>
Brothers do whatever it
takes to help out when
their Brothers are in trouble.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
Geo...
You're always teaching me
more and more about life.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
...Heh, it looks like you've
softened up a bit.
<PUSH>
But anyway, what's the
situation looking like?
<PUSH>
Is there some way to stop
the black hole?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
We've tried everything within
our arsenal.
<PUSH>
Nothing has had an effect
on the black hole.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
What about that super
powerful weapon that the
government was working on?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
You mean the Ultimate Wave
Force Missile.
It had little to no effect.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Geez!
<PUSH>
Well, did you sortie the
defense troops for an
attack on the core?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
Yes. They were completely
wiped out...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
What!? That's...!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
There is nothing we can do.
<PUSH>
According to our analysis...
We have exactly one day
<PUSH>
before Planet FM is
swallowed by the black hole.
<PUSH>
I have just ordered every
citizen of Planet FM to
<PUSH>
board our resonance rockets
for evacuation.
<PUSH>
Geo...{15}{E1}
Thank you for coming, but...
Please return to Earth.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
!!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
FM King!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
Sirius and his black hole are
just too much.
<PUSH>
Losing one's home is a
tragic event.
<PUSH>
Yet, as king, my first duty
is to keep my people safe.
<PUSH>
I share the same duty to
you, as your Brother.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
...
<PUSH>
.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}One day, right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
Geo?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
What if we could stop Sirius
and his black hole within one
day?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
Don't even think about it!
My decision has been made,
and that's final!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I understand.
...But I can't accept
what Sirius is doing!
<PUSH>
He has no right to do this
to you and your people!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
I'm with the kid on this one!
<PUSH>
There's no way I can just
sit around and watch my
home planet be destroyed!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
Geo... Omega-Xis...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
Mega and I are going into
the black hole.
<PUSH>
And we'll defeat Sirius!
<PUSH>
...But I can't promise that
Planet FM will be saved
from being swallowed up.
<PUSH>
So please continue with your
evacuation plans, Cepheus.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
Geo...{15}{E1}
I don't know what to say...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
...
<PUSH>
Just tell me that you believe
in me. A Brother's trust is
invaluable.
<PUSH>
Cepheus, please head back!
We'll take care of this.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Cepheus>
...
<PUSH>
I believe in you, Mega Man.
<PUSH>
As a Brother...
And as a representative of
Planet FM.
<PUSH>

Mega...
<PUSH>
Do you know how I
feel right now?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Of course...
You seem unusually angry
and ready for a fight.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Megaman>
I guess you know me well.
<PUSH>
So why don't you get fired
up with me!?
<PUSH>
Let's rock, Mega!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Yeah! But how about a little
blues every once in a while!?
