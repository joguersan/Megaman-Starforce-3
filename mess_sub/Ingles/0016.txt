<Ace>
It looks like it's up and
running.
<PUSH>
The main feature of my
<AcePrgm> is the Noise
Change... When the
<PUSH>
<AcePrgm> encounters high
concentrations of Noise,
it installs itself and
<PUSH>
resonates with the Noise,
summoning more of the
same resonant Noise from
<PUSH>
a server in space. This
way, Noise no longer
<PUSH>
harms Mega Man, it makes
him stronger as he
draws more of it into
<PUSH>
himself. This power
doesn't come without
risk, and for that I
<PUSH>
apologize. But it was my
belief that you, Geo,
<PUSH>
would be able to keep
the Noise under control.
<PUSH>
Now let me explain to you
how the Noise change
works.
<PUSH>
The system can't be fully
effective unless your
<PUSH>
Noise level is greater than
50 percent.
<PUSH>
At less than 50 percent
your color remains blue,
<PUSH>
and some of your Battle
Card Attack Power Ups and
abilities will be unusable.
<PUSH>
That is called your
Noise Form.
<PUSH>
But, at greater than
50 percent,
your combat effectiveness
<PUSH>
will increase markedly.
You'll gain extra color and
charged attacks,
<PUSH>
Counters, NFBs (Noise
Force Big Bang), etc. will
<PUSH>
all be at your disposal.
If you want to fight
<PUSH>
normally, all you need to
do is unequip the <AcePrgm>
from your Abilities.
<PUSH>
Was there anything else I
needed to tell you
<PUSH>
about...? Oh, yes...
While it is true that the
<PUSH>
higher your Noise Level,
the better fighter you
should be, if your Noise
<PUSH>
Level rises too high -
say above 200 percent,
<PUSH>
it's uncertain what could
happen...
<PUSH>
But I know that
you'll be alright, Geo.
<PUSH>
You're every bit the hero
I thought you were! Go
get 'em!

Hello, Geo.
<PUSH>
I hope you're doing well.
<PUSH>
There's something I
learned about Noise
Changing that I wanted to
<PUSH>
share with you.
There's the possibility
<PUSH>
that you, having Noise
Changed once already,
<PUSH>
could spontaneously
Noise Change in the
<PUSH>
presence of very strong
Noise.
<PUSH>
Also, Arthur may have
told you this already, but
<PUSH>
fighting especially large
viruses may also cause
you to Noise Change,
<PUSH>
because of their ability to
affect the area
<PUSH>
surrounding them by
creating balls of Noise.
<PUSH>
There is still much we
don't know about the
Noise Change...
<PUSH>
So, please, Geo,
be careful.

So, how do you like that
Astro Wave?
<PUSH>
By the way, did you ever
use that <AcePrgm> I gave
you in battle?
<PUSH>
When it's installed,
you'll see a Noise Level
<PUSH>
gauge on the upper right
of the screen.
<PUSH>
The gauge rises and falls
depending on the battle
situation.
<PUSH>
Until about 99 percent,
you won't be affected
<PUSH>
much. But after 100%,
be careful!
<PUSH>
All sorts of strange
phenomena have been
observed. For example,
<PUSH>
you may get hit with an
attack even though you
are flashing.
<PUSH>
Or you land an attack
that is supposed to blow
enemies back,
<PUSH>
but instead it draws
them toward you.
<PUSH>
Also, this hasn't been
confirmed, but Noise may
<PUSH>
cause your acquired data
to be converted into data
<PUSH>
that is totally unrelated
to the enemy you have
deleted.
<PUSH>
These are just some of
the reports that have
come in.
<PUSH>
We're not quite sure
what conditions govern
the rise of Noise levels,
<PUSH>
but early reports suggest
that when a non-dimming,
<PUSH>
non-elemental card is
used to delete a virus,
<PUSH>
the difference of the
card's attack power and
<PUSH>
the virus's HP correlates
to the percentage of
Noise elevation.
<PUSH>
I'd advise caution. But you,
Mega Man, may be able to
<PUSH>
control it as Noise
levels rise.
<PUSH>
I guess it all boils down to,
don't overdo it.

Noise Cards come in four

You should try to enter

If you enter cards from
different suits,

Oh, that reminds me...

If you happen to get a

You can make poker

You can touch the

Once you've done that,
it's a good idea to talk to
them some more to get

you... oh I mean Mega Man

though no valid reasons

you can't complete a

given, you can go back

mission.

But don't worry, you can
accept the mission as

resolve the issue!
<PUSH>
Oh, one more thing.

Once you've taken a
mission request from
<PUSH>
someone, until you either
complete or cancel it,
<PUSH>
pop-ups from other
