3I will now explain to
you about the White Cards
<PUSH>
which you have
downloaded.
<PUSH>
White Cards are the
4 card sets of
<PUSH>
Battle Cards available
at every Wave Station.
<PUSH>
Of course, these white
colored cards can be
used in battle.
<PUSH>
Even the same Wave
Station can have
different sets of
<PUSH>
White Cards, and some
sets are unique to
<PUSH>
Wave Stations in a
particular region.
<PUSH>
So, if you see a
Wave Station, be sure
to download a set.
<PUSH>
If there is ever a
White Card that you
don't want to use in
<PUSH>
battle, you can go to
the Folder Edit Screen,
<PUSH>
select it with the
cursor and press the
Y Button or the
<PUSH>
A Button to remove it
from your folder.
<PUSH>
White Cards will have
a "W" mark next to
their names.
<PUSH>
This concludes the
explanation about
White Cards.

OK, before I forget,
let me give you a
<PUSH>
quick review of Folders
and how they work.
<PUSH>
Folders are containers
where you put
Battle Cards.
<PUSH>
At the start of a battle,
cards picked at
<PUSH>
random are displayed
on the bottom screen.
<PUSH>
So whether you're at
an advantage or
a disadvantage depends
<PUSH>
on what kind of cards
you have put into your
Folder.
<PUSH>
You can fill your Folder
with cards that you find
easy to use,
<PUSH>
or you can try to have
a more balanced spread
of cards.
<PUSH>
It really boils down
to your own tastes.
<PUSH>
There's also something
called a Card Box that
<PUSH>
is used when you get
new Battle Cards.
<PUSH>
By moving cards back
and forth between your
Card Box and Folders,
<PUSH>
you can determine a
Folder's contents.
<PUSH>
But there are rules for
putting cards into
Folders.
<PUSH>
The first is that a
Folder always has to
contain 30 cards.
<PUSH>
A Folder can't have more
than 5 Standard Class
cards of the same name.
<PUSH>
You can put a maximum
of 5 rare Mega Class
cards in a Folder.
<PUSH>
And for the very rare
Giga Class cards, there's
a limit of only one.
<PUSH>
Be aware that you can't
have more than 1 Mega
Class or Giga Class card of
<PUSH>
the same name in a folder.
Also, Standard Class cards,
<PUSH>
Mega Class cards, and
Giga Class cards aren't
the only ones out there.
<PUSH>
There are many different
types of cards.
<PUSH>
Man! All this talk about
Battle Cards is getting me
all fired up!
<PUSH>
Since all this Folder business
is now taken care of, we
can go have some fun!

The other day in class we
learned about battling
<PUSH>
and what to do if we
encounter a virus, right?
<PUSH>
Well Prez wanted me to
write up a summary of the
Custom Screen so that we
<PUSH>
can refer to it in an
emergency, so I did.
<PUSH>
This is a copy for you, Geo.
<PUSH>
The first thing you'll see
when you meet an enemy
is the Custom Screen.
<PUSH>
Six cards are randomly
selected from the 30 cards
<PUSH>
that are in your Folder, and
then displayed there.
<PUSH>
That doesn't mean
you can just choose any
cards you want.
<PUSH>
There are rules for these
kinds of things.
<PUSH>
Rule #1!
Cards in the same column
can be selected together.
<PUSH>
It doesn't matter if they're
not lined up exactly
straight, as long as
<PUSH>
they're in the same
column.
<PUSH>
Rule #2!
Three cards in the same row
can be picked together.
<PUSH>
It doesn't matter if they're
not lined up exactly
<PUSH>
straight, as long as
they're in the same row.
<PUSH>
Rule #3!
<PUSH>
Cards that have the same
name can be picked together,
regardless of their position.
<PUSH>
The exception are
White Cards, which can
<PUSH>
be paired with any card
anywhere on the screen.
Very useful, right?
<PUSH>
Finally, you can use the
R Button or Y Button to
see card descriptions.
<PUSH>
OK! I think that about sums
up the Custom Screen.
<PUSH>
That took forever to
explain!

Hey, Geo! This is a

<PUSH>
I thought you'd find it
useful, so I'm sending
it to you.
<PUSH>
You can move left
and right using the
+Control Pad,
<PUSH>
and you can use a
card by pressing the
A Button.
<PUSH>
Holding down the
B Button will unleash
<PUSH>
a rapid-fire attack from
the Mega Buster.
<PUSH>
Not pressing the
B Button for a while
<PUSH>
will let the Mega Buster
charge up. Once it does,
<PUSH>
fire with the B Button
for a Charged Shot!
<PUSH>
Speaking of charging,
once the Custom
Gauge fills,
<PUSH>
press the L Button
or R Button to see the
Custom Screen.
<PUSH>
Well, I guess that about
sums it up.

I thought I'd send you

<PUSH>
Press the Y Button to

<PUSH>
You can use the shield
to block enemy attacks.
<PUSH>
You won't have to worry
about this much with
weaker enemies,
<PUSH>
but later, there will be
some enemy attacks that
<PUSH>
you can't dodge by just
moving left or right.
<PUSH>
That's when you'll need
to use the shield to
guard yourself.
<PUSH>
But you won't be able
to block everything,
<PUSH>
you know. You can't
block an enemy's
rush attack,
<PUSH>
and some attacks will
be able to break through
your shield.
<PUSH>
So be very careful.

Nobody bothered to
explain the Mega Attack!?
<PUSH>
That figures, since I'm
the only expert on the
subject.
<PUSH>
Anyway, here goes!
<PUSH>
The Mega Attack is
very important.
<PUSH>
When you have cards
that you can use,
<PUSH>
press down on the
+Control Pad and I'll
<PUSH>
switch into lock-on
mode.
<PUSH>
When I'm in that mode,
a sight will be shown
on any enemies
<PUSH>
directly or diagonally in
front of us. If you use a
card when a sight is on,
<PUSH>
we'll rush right up to
the enemy and attack!
<PUSH>
But keep in mind that
some non-attack type
cards,
<PUSH>
such as recovery
cards and cards that dim
<PUSH>
the screen cannot be
used with lock-on mode.
<PUSH>
Oh, and if you don't like
the camera changing on
<PUSH>
you when you do a
Mega Attack,
<PUSH>
you can change the
the camera settings
<PUSH>
by pressing START
during a battle.
<PUSH>
Remember, kid.
You don't have to use
<PUSH>
the Mega Attack in every
fight you're in, but when you
<PUSH>
do, you'll be able to fight
on a much higher level!

<Bud>
Here's the lowdown on
Countering and
Bonus Cards.
<PUSH>
If you land a card
attack on an enemy
<PUSH>
just as they're about to
attack, that's a Counter.
<PUSH>
That'll catch them off-guard,
paralyzing them for a time.
<PUSH>
You'll also receive a Bonus
Card for doing so.
<PUSH>
Usually, you can only use
cards you select on the
Custom Screen. But if you
<PUSH>
land a Counter, then you'll
be rewarded a Bonus Card.
<PUSH>
Bonus Cards are chosen
from your Card Folder
at random.
<PUSH>
Even so, they're great
because you don't have to
wait for the Custom Gauge
<PUSH>
to fill up before going buck
wild on the enemy!
<PUSH>
Counters can only be
performed with attack cards
that don't dim the screen.
<PUSH>
And you can't get another
Bonus Card if you pull off a
Counter with a Bonus Card.
<PUSH>
So don't think you can
get an unlimited chain
of cards.
<PUSH>
The timing of Counters is
tough, but they're really cool
when you can pull them off.
<PUSH>
You should practice a little
until you get the hang of it!
