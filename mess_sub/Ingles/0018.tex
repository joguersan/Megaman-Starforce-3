<Sonia> There's this one battle card I want. It's called the "{B2}{E7}"... 
.My twin brother moved to a condo here in <Echo.Ridge>. 
I'm here to see him but every time I enter his room number, I get an error.

<Bud> I was at home about to dig into my homemade ginger beef when I 
realized that I was forgetting something! 
The ever important spices!! 
I went to the fridge to get the spices, but when I came back, I was faced 
with an empty bowl! Who could have eaten my ginger beef like that!? 
)If you can find a "{79}{E7}" card, 
I will trade you an "{D4}{E7}" card for it. 
OK? Just let me know when you have one. 
-I'm looking for a card called "{8F}{E7}". 
<Candy.Bar> While I was out virus busting, my Hunter-VG went on the fritz, 
I wonder if it can be fixed?
