......
<PUSH>
Oh, my. It looks like
you turned off the power
in the middle of a
<PUSH>
Wi-Fi head-to-head match. 
{2C}{E1}, that was
very unsporting of you.
<PUSH>
Turning off the power
like that will cause
the other party to get
<PUSH>
a communication error.
Don't you know that?
<PUSH>
Wave Battlers must
fight fairly all the way till
the end, no matter what.
<PUSH>
What's that you say?
<PUSH>
You didn't do it on
purpose? It was an
accident?
<PUSH>
Well, I suppose
things like that can
happen now and again.
<PUSH>
I apologize for accusing
you of playing unfairly.
<PUSH>
But did you know that
even when you turn the
power off in the middle
<PUSH>
of a Wi-Fi head-to-head
match, even accidentally,
<PUSH>
it is counted in the
Wi-Fi battle results
record as a Null Battle?
<PUSH>
If you get too many null
battles, people will
think of you as a person
<PUSH>
who always turns the
power off when you are
losing.
<PUSH>
And we wouldn't want that
now, would we?
<PUSH>
So from now on, please be
very careful.
<PUSH>
Oh, dear. There I go again
running off at the mouth.
<PUSH>
You know how Arthur gets
when I just ramble on
and on.
<PUSH>
......
<PUSH>
So move on, get back
out there and have
some Wave Battle fun!
<PUSH>

<Dr.Goodall>
It's a shame that we have
to meet back here like
this, {2C}{E1}.
<PUSH>
I don't like to have to come
here and lecture you,
you know.
<PUSH>
So, where should I begin?
Oh, I know. Have you ever
been in love?
<PUSH>
Well I may not look it now,
but when I was your age,
I was a very popular girl.
<PUSH>
I couldn't take 10 steps on
<Alohaha> Beach without
some boy cat-calling me.
<PUSH>
*chuckle* But that's a
whole 'nother story. What
I want to tell you is
<PUSH>
there's a difference
between infatuation and love.
<PUSH>
To be infatuated with
someone is easy.
<PUSH>
Your heart goes
pit-a-pat when you see
that person, but it isn't
<PUSH>
necessary to get to know
how they feel.
<PUSH>
It's a one-way emotion.
<PUSH>
But love, on the other hand,
is different.
<PUSH>
When you love someone, you
care about how that person
feels; what makes them
<PUSH>
happy as well as what
makes them sad.
<PUSH>
It takes effort to love,
and it's not something you
do alone.
<PUSH>
I know now that those
boys on the beach
were infatuated with me,
<PUSH>
but probably weren't in
love with me.
<PUSH>
They were just children.
And so it is with
Wave Battling.
<PUSH>
Turning off the power when
you are going to lose...
That's a very
<PUSH>
mean and quite frankly,
selfish thing to do.
<PUSH>
Great Wave Battlers think
about the feelings of
their opponents.
<PUSH>
Even when we lose, we must
be thankful for the mere
opportunity to have battled.
<PUSH>
Do you understand?
<PUSH>
If we battle fair and square,
we create an atmosphere
where everyone has fun.
<PUSH>
I think you've got the
message, so I'll cut my
lecture short this time.
<PUSH>
Thank you for
paying attention.
<PUSH>
OK, get back out there
and do your best!
<PUSH>

......
<PUSH>
Why.... you little! Get
your act together right
this instant! ...... 
<PUSH>
*chuckle* I bet I gave
you a scare, didn't I?
<PUSH>
I was once asked if I would
be an actress.
<PUSH>
But never mind that now.
<PUSH>
Once again, you turned
off the power in the
<PUSH>
middle of a Wi-Fi
head-to-head match.
<PUSH>
And this time I can't just
stand by and look the
other way.
<PUSH>
This time there will be
consequences. {2C}{E1},
I'll give you a choice.
<PUSH>
I can take away your right
to get Illegal Cards.
<PUSH>
That means that all
Illegal Cards that you
get will have to be
<PUSH>
surrendered to WAZA and
the Satella Police
Department. Or,
<PUSH>
I can confiscate all the
Battle Cards currently in
your possession.
<PUSH>
Which is it
going to be?
{10}{EC}{00}{00}Give up right to Illegal Cards
{10}{EC}{01}{00}Give up all Battle Cards

This should help you stop

Well, I guess I'm done
here.
<PUSH>
Good-b...
What's that you say?
<PUSH>
If you're really sorry, will I
undo your punishment?
<PUSH>
That's going to be a little
tough, youngin'.
<PUSH>
The world has rules so
that order is preserved,

and punishments for those
who break them.

You're sorry from the
bottom of your heart?

Well I don't know...

OK, but I want to
be sure that you are
