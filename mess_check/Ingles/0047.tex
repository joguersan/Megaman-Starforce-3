<Game> The WAZA gate is closed. 
<Geo> Are these Noise clusters!? 
<Mega> Bah! They're blocking the path! 
<Geo> Well, if it's the same kind of stuff that was in the 
sprinkler, then we can handle it no problem! 
Let's do this. Help us out, everyone! 
<Taurus.Fire> OK!! 
<HarpNote> My pleasure! 
<Mega> {13}{EC}...! 
Be careful, kid! I hate viruses! 
<Geo> {13}{EC}!! 
<Mega> There's more here!? 
<Geo> There are viruses, too! 
Come on, everyone! 
<Geo> *sigh* There are still more of them! 
<Mega> Sometimes life kicks you while you're down, kid! 
Let's kick it back! 
<Game> Noise is blocking the path... 
<Mega> This stuff doesn't look like we can break it! Forget it, kid!
