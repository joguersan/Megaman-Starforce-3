{0A}{E1}ï¿½
<Game> It's a large monitor. 
It's displaying an ominous red shooting star. 
<Game> It's a gigantic piece of equipment. There's something sinister about it.

<Geo> I wonder where this leads to? 
<Mega> I think it leads to space... 
<Geo> Then we better not open it!

<Game> Many monitors are lined up. There's a bunch of data displayed on them. 
<Game> It's a gigantic piece of equipment. 
<Geo> I think they control Meteor G with this. 
<Mega> Then I think we'd better tear it to pieces right away! 
<Geo> Mega, I think that might cause even more problems for us.
