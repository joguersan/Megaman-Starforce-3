I'll tell you a bit about Echo Ridge Elementary this time. *woof* 
The school has a very long and prominent history. 
Every brother or sister, mom or dad, grandmother 
or grandfather living in <Echo.Ridge> went there! 
The original principal was very proud of his exquisite beard. *woof* 
However... He went to trim his beard and... 
Accidentally{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} 
Cut the whole thing off! 
Actually, the statue in the entrance of the school is 
a statue of him when he was younger... 
It's of him before he cut his beard off. *woof* 
There's a rumor going around between the students that 
the beard of the statue grows longer every year! 
The regret and remorse of the principal dwells within the statue. *woof* 
It's one of the seven wonders of Echo Ridge Elementary. *woof* 
Oh, and by the way... 
If you find all of the seven wonders... 
... 
...I-I can't say. *woof* It's too terrible... *woof*
