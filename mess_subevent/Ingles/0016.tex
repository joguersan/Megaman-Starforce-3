<Mr.Boreal> I'm looking for people that want to trade Battle Cards! 
<Geo> Are you a Battle Card collector, Mr. Boreal? 
<Mr.Boreal> You got it. 
The designs are just amazing, don't you think? 
Haha! 
Just thinking about Battle Cards gets me all giddy. 
Oh, by the way, Geo... 
Do you have the Battle Card "{6A}{E7}"? 
If you do, would you trade it to me for a "{28}{E8}"? 
{17}{EC}{00}{00} 
<Game> Trade? {05}{EC}{00}{00}{04}{00}  {06}{EC}Yes   {09}{EC}No 
{17}{EC}{02}{00}{11}{EC}{00}{00}{04}{00}{11}{EC}{03}{00}{05}{00}
<Mr.Boreal> Great, thank you. 
Talk to me again once you are ready to trade.

<Mr.Boreal> I see... Please let me know if you change your mind.

{17}{EC}{02}{00}{11}{EC}{00}{00}{0B}{00}{11}{EC}{03}{00}{08}{00}

<Mr.Boreal> Let me know if you get ahold of one. 
<Mr.Boreal> Thanks. 
I'm now that much closer to completing my set. 
Here's the Battle Card that I promised you. 
{80}{E1}ï¿½{01}{00}{A1}{E1} 
<Game> {35}{EC} got: "{28}{E8}"!
