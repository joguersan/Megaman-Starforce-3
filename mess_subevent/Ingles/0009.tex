<Candy.Bar> Now accepting challengers for hide-and-seek! 
<Geo> Aww man, time's up. 
<Candy.Bar> Woo hoo! I win! 
<Mega> I can't believe we lost. How humiliating... 
<Geo> Let's challenge him again. 
<Candy.Bar> I am a master of the game hide-and-seek. 
I've never lost to a single person in my whole life! 
<Mega> (...For real?) 
<Geo> What rules do you play by? 
<Candy.Bar> They're pretty simple. 
You win if you can find me within one minute! 
And I'll give you something if you find me, too.

I won't hide in any buildings or other areas. 
Are you ready?
