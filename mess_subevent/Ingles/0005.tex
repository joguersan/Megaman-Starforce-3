)I'm looking for a top quality game! Can you assist me? 
)I love video games so much. 
But... 
Lately, developers have been focusing too much on graphics and sound. 
And therefore over-looking what really makes a game fun... 
It's so upsetting! 
<Geo> Umm... 
Is something wrong? 
)Well, I'm looking for two games: "{93}{E5}" and "{94}{E5}"... 
But they are so popular that I can't find them at any store I go to. 
And the more I can't find them, the more I want them.

<Game> Help this person? {05}{EC}{00}{00}{04}{00}  {06}{EC}Yes   {09}{EC}No 
{17}{EC}{02}{00}{11}{EC}{00}{00}{05}{00}{11}{EC}{03}{00}{06}{00}
<Geo> If you want, I could look for them for you. 
)Would you really!? That would be so awesome! 
They both sold out right away even when I waited in line for them. 
<Geo> Time to find a place that sells video games.

)It's impossible, isn't it...? 
{0B}{E1}{33}{16}
)Huh? 
Did you find both "{93}{E5}" and "{94}{E5}" already? 
I want to play them both in a row, so it would be great if you brought them together.

<Game> Cancel this request? {05}{EC}{00}{00}{04}{00}  {06}{EC}Yes   {09}{EC}No 
{17}{EC}{02}{00}{11}{EC}{00}{00}{08}{00}{11}{EC}{03}{00}{09}{00}
)Oh... Well, please let me know if you change your mind.

<Geo> I found the games. 
)Woo hoo! Here, take this. 
{85}{E1}{00}{00}{01}{00}{A1}{E1} 
<Game> {35}{EC} got: "{E0}{E5}"! 
HP capacity has been increased! 
{81}{E1}{C8}{32}{A1}{E1} 
<Game> {35}{EC} got: "13000 Zennys"!
