<Zack> All of the electronic appliances in my room broke. 
Maybe I'm paying the price for not eating my carrots the other night. 
<Zack> 
<Geo> Everything that's electronic in your room broke? 
<Zack> Yes! 
Nothing is working! Not even my video game systems!

<Zack> Sorry to trouble you. But thanks for helping! 
{0A}{E1}{16}{16}{20}{EC}{DB}{10}

<Zack> Thanks for helping! 
<Geo> Everything should work now.

What would people do without friends like you, Geo? 
Please take this as a token of my appreciation.

<Game> Geo's Link Power went up by 40. 
<Mega> Whoa! That's a lot of viruses! 
<Geo> It's kind of creepy, like a bunch of cockroaches. 
<Game> REPORT ON TODAY'S DATA DELETION! 
<Game> METTA! METTA! 
13 ELECTRONIC APPLIANCES WERE BROKEN! 
<Geo> ...

INTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT! 
<Mega> You guys are the ones who are intruding! 
Let's tear 'em up, kid! 
<Geo> Phew... 
Intense... 
But I'm glad we were able to help out Zack. Time to go tell him! 
<Mega> What's your problem, kid!?
