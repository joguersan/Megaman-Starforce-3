<Angel.Wise> I really want to get Woody to try this amazing health drink I heard about. 
<Angel.Wise> I wonder if Woody is alright all by himself...? 
<Geo> It looks like you're worried about Woody. 
<Angel.Wise> I am, actually. 
He's been working so hard, I'm worried that he's going to wear himself out... 
I want to get him to try a health drink that you can get in <Alohaha>.

This drink is so strong. 
<Geo> Thank goodness you woke back up. 
I should go tell your fellow club members that I got you the drink.

Do you know what it's made from?
