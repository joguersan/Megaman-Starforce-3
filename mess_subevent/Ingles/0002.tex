<Jack.Flask> I lost it... *sigh* 
<Jack.Flask> *sigh* Where could it have gone? 
<Geo> Umm... 
Is something wrong? 
<Jack.Flask> Yeah... I found out I did really bad on my test. 
I didn't want my mom to see it, so I made it into a paper airplane and threw it away. 
But she found out that I had a test, and now I have to show it to her or else. 
But I have no idea where it is. 
Please help me!

<Game> Help this person? {05}{EC}{00}{00}{04}{00}  {06}{EC}Yes   {09}{EC}No

<Geo> Sure, I'll go look for it. 
Which way did you throw it? 
<Jack.Flask> Since I threw it from here, it should be somewhere in <Echo.Ridge>. 
<Mega> We should head for <Echo.Ridge> then, kid. 
<Jack.Flask> I understand. I'll just look for it by myself. 
{0B}{E1}{30}{16}
<Jack.Flask> Did you find my test? 
{17}{EC}{00}{00} 
<Game> Cancel this request? {05}{EC}{00}{00}{04}{00}  {06}{EC}Yes   {09}{EC}No

<Jack.Flask> Tell me when you find it! 
<Geo> Here you go. 
But you probably shouldn't do something like that again. 
<Jack.Flask> Don't worry, I won't! Thank you so much! Here, this is for you.

<Game> {35}{EC} got: "{E0}{E5}"! 
HP capacity has been increased! 
<Jack.Flask> I'm really scared to do what I have to do next. 
<Jack.Flask> You should come with me to see my mom. 
<Geo> No way! 
<Geo> This looks like the test paper of that kid from the roof. 
<Mega> So what was his score? Show me, show me! 
<Geo> N-No way. That's on a need-to-know basis and we don't need to know. 
{17}{EC}{00}{00}{05}{EC}{00}{00}{04}{00}  {06}{EC}Look   {09}{EC}Don't look

<Game> {35}{EC} got: "{8D}{E5}"! 
<Game> Geo opened the paper airplane. 
<Mega> See, I knew you were curious about his score. 
Whoa{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} 0 points!? 
<Geo> It was multiple choice, too... 
That's some bad luck there. 
<Mega> That's such a bad score I might throw up. 
<Geo> Let's bring it back to him.
