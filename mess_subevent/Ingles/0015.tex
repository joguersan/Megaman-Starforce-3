<Someone please go get the lunches for the staff! I'm too busy! 
<Busy, busy, busy. 
I'll take all the help that I can get! 
<Geo> Umm... 
Is something wrong? 
<Well... 
I just ordered lunch for the staff, but I don't have time to go and pick it up.

<Geo> If it will help, I don't mind going to pick up the lunches for the staff. 
<Really!? Thank you so much! 
If you could pick up the order and make sure the 
staff gets their lunches, I'd really appreciate it. 
I ordered them from the Echo Ridge Elementary school store. 
<Geo> OK, got it!

<I would have been in deep trouble if it wasn't for you. 
<Argh, I'm so hungry I could eat a house... 
Where are those lunches? 
<Geo> Here's your lunch, sir. 
<I was almost a goner there! 
Thanks, kiddo! 
<Time to pig out! 
=I'm starving. 
I can't concentrate on work without some food in me. 
<Geo> Here's your lunch, ma'am. 
=Thank you! 
You're the cutest delivery boy I've ever seen. 
=I'll be able to focus on work after I eat! 
<It's almost break time, but I still don't have my lunch. 
<Geo> Here's your lunch, sir. 
<You're delivering the lunches? 
I guess he was too busy. 
Thanks for helping. 
<Fooooood!
