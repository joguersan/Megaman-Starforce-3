.I came all the way from the countryside to see my little brother. 
.This should have been the right number... 
<Geo> Is there something that I can help you with? 
.Maybe. 
I came to visit my little brother who just moved to an apartment in <Echo.Ridge>. 
But... 
An error pops up whenever I enter the room number. 
{17}{EC}{00}{00} 
<Game> Help this person? {05}{EC}{00}{00}{04}{00}  {06}{EC}Yes   {09}{EC}No 
{17}{EC}{02}{00}{11}{EC}{00}{00}{05}{00}{11}{EC}{03}{00}{06}{00}
<Geo> If you need any help, I'll be more than happy to help. 
.What a nice kid. That would be great. 
Here, take this memo with the room number on it. 
{A1}{E1} 
<Game> {35}{EC} got: "{9F}{E5}"! 
.You can enter the room number when you stand in front of the apartment. 
{0A}{E1}{22}{16}{0A}{E1}{9B}{16}{82}{E1}/{01}{00}{20}{EC}{E1}{10}
.This stinks. 
I even brought a couple of crates of local sweet corn for him. 
{0B}{E1}{40}{16}
.Did you happen to find out where my brother lives!? 
{17}{EC}{00}{00} 
<Game> Cancel this request? {05}{EC}{00}{00}{04}{00}  {06}{EC}Yes   {09}{EC}No 
{17}{EC}{02}{00}{11}{EC}{00}{00}{08}{00}{11}{EC}{03}{00}{09}{00}

.I know I can count on you. 
.I can't believe I was reading it upside down. 
Thank you. Now I can go see my brother. 
It must have been fate that I bumped into you today. 
Umm, I don't really get many chances to form Brother Bands in the country side... 
Would you please form a Brother Band with me? 
<Geo> I'd be happy to! 
{6E}{E1}{00}{00}# 
<Game> Geo and {C3}{E2} formed a Brother Band! 
Geo's Link Power went up by 40. 
<Geo> Please say hello to your brother for me. 
.Well... 
It's time to go put the sweet corn on the grill.
