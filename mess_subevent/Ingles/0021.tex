)Who wants to trade Battle Cards!? 
)I trade Battle Cards with my friends all the time. 
I always want to trade ultra rare cards, but my friends 
never offer anything but boring common cards. 
In Japanese they call that "kechi", which means stingy. 
<Geo> I don't mind trading some Battle Cards with you. 
)It looks like you have a lot of different cards on you. 
Sure, let's do some trading.

Talk to me again when you're ready to trade.
