<Hope(Mom)> Geo...! Do you have a minute? 
<Geo> Uhh... Sure, what is it, Mom? 
<Hope(Mom)> Geo... Isn't there something that you want to tell me? 
<Geo> Huh...!? 
<Mega> Wait a second, kid! 
You're mom seems a bit off, doesn't she!? Go check on her! 
<Mega> Hey, kid! I think you should talk to your mom before you leave! 
She looks worried about something... 
<Mega> H-Hey, kid! 
Your mom looks upset... 
Shouldn't you see if there's anything wrong?
