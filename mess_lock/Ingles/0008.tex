<Mega> Hey! Let's get on the Wave Road and delete those viruses! 
<Geo> Let's go tell Woody that all of the viruses are gone. 
<Geo> Prez is waiting for us on the first floor. We better get a move on! 
<Mega> Come on, kid! Those viruses in the Sprinkler CC need deleting! 
<Mega> It might not be a bad idea to go see that Woody guy. 
<Mega> Prez is waiting on us, huh? To the first floor we go! 
<Mega> There's someone at the entrance, right? You better get a move on.
