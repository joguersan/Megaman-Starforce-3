<Game> The main computer room gate is locked... 
Entrance is forbidden without proper identification. 
<Geo> Wow... It's like super top secret! 
<Mega> Why the heck are you so excited about that? 
<Mega> Where are you going, kid!? We already cleaned house over there! 
<Mega> It's way too dangerous to cancel your EM Wave Change! 
<Mega> Whoa! Now's not the time for that! 
<Mega> We're almost done here! Stay frosty, kid! 
<Megaman> I can't leave WAZA at a time like this! 
<Mega> I don't think we can go in. It's too classified! 
<Game> = Access Forbidden = CC Access Key is required to trans in. 
<Megaman> I have to get to the main computer room ASAP!
