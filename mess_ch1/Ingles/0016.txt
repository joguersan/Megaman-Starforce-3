I'll say it again, Geo.

I'm a fan of Mega Man,

[SENTENCE NUMBER 18]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Brother Bands are a way
to connect oneself to
<PUSH>
close and trusted friends
through EM waves.
<PUSH>
Even if separated by
great distances, anyone
<PUSH>
can stay aware of their
Brother's current state.
<PUSH>
Even if not friends, one
can become a Brother with
anyone they care about.
<PUSH>
For example, family
members can become
Brothers.
<PUSH>
My mother and father are
my Brothers. So when they
are both busy at work,
<PUSH>
we keep each other
updated via the
Brother Band system.
<PUSH>
No matter how much
technology advances,
<PUSH>
and no matter how
convenient it becomes,
<PUSH>
one's connection to others
will always be the most
important thing.
<PUSH>
From those connections
the mysterious power called
Link Power is born.
<PUSH>
Link Power displays the
strength of a link via a
number.
<PUSH>
The more one is trusted
by their Brother, the more
<PUSH>
Link Power one gains
from that Brother.
<PUSH>
Helping out one another
and forming a deeper link
will also raise Link Power.
<PUSH>
Once Link Power reaches
a certain level, Abilities can
be equipped.
<PUSH>
I'm not an expert, but it
seems that Link Power is
<PUSH>
connected to one's
strength as well.
<PUSH>
You can check how much
Link Power someone is
giving you by talking to
<PUSH>
them and touching the
Brother Band pop-up.
<PUSH>
By the way, one can also
form Brother Bands with
<PUSH>
real life friends. They are
called Real Brothers.
