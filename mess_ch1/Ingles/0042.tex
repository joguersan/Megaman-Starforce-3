<Megaman> Magnes! 
<Magnes> Ugh, what did I... 
<Megaman> {13}{EC}... 
<Mega> What's wrong, Geo? 
<Megaman> N-Nothing... I had a strange feeling in my body for a second, but I'm fine now. 
But more importantly... One of those cards fell off again. 
<Magnes> It's called a "Noise Card". 
The two people that made me go out of control called it that. 
<Megaman> Two people, huh... That might be who Ace called "dangerous people". 
<Mega> Noise cards... Dangerous people... 
Looks like we should stay frosty, kid. 
<Magnes> At any rate! Thanks so much for saving me! 
Now it's time to fix things! 
I'm going to make sure the Science Club's dream comes true! 
<Megaman> You're the best, Magnes! 
<Magnes> Yup! 
<Mega> Time to trans out, Geo! 
<Megaman> OK! 
<Magnes> The only way to go is in style!
