<Game> *alarm siren* 
<Prez> W-What's going on!? 
<Zack> It looks like the Security System was activated. 
<Geo-2> But, why? I haven't seen or heard anything strange... 
<Bud> Hey, what should we do!? We're trapped! 
<Mega> Hey, kid!! 
<Geo-2> I know, Mega! 
The Security System should be here somewhere... 
<Pedia> According to my <Spica.Mall> map, the Security System is behind that door. 
However, the construction of the building is quite complicated. 
<Geo-2> Thanks, Pedia! 
I'll turn into Mega Man and investigate the Security Sys CC!
