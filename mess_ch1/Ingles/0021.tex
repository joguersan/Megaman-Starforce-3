<Angel.Wise> Hmm, this is strange... 
<Geo> Do you need some help? 
<Prez> Anything new, Geo? 
<Geo> Hey, Prez. I just noticed her. 
<Mega> ...Yo, Prez. 
<Prez> Yes? 
<Mega> Is it just me or are you just following Geo around? 
<Prez> W-What? How dare you! 
<Geo> ...? 
<Mega> It can't be sheer luck that you just show up as soon as Geo finds someone. 
<Prez> Since Geo is unreliable I've just been checking in on him from time to time! 
I can't let him mess up, because his mistake will hurt the whole Team! 
I think we're just having a misunderstanding here, Omega-Xis. 
<Mega> Is that so... Sorry. 
<Geo> ...? 
<Prez> Anyway... That kid is having some trouble! 
<Geo> Hey... Is there something wrong? 
We can help you out. 
<Angel.Wise> Oh, um... 
I had a fight with my friend and she hasn't replied to my e-mail. 
She must still be angry with me... 
<Geo> So you haven't called her? 
<Angel.Wise> No. I'm too embarrassed to call her and have her see my face on the screen. 
<Prez> Do you know where she is right now? 
<Angel.Wise> She's probably in the park in <Echo.Ridge>. 
<Prez> Geo, there may be another reason for her not  responding to her friend. 
<Mega> What should we do, kid? 
<Geo> Let's go to the park!
