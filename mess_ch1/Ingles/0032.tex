<Game> *gasp* 
<Game> It really is Mega Man!! 
<Megaman> They seem pretty excited to see me... 
<Game> *munch, munch* 
<Ace> So you finally showed up. You kept us waiting. 
<Ace> Should we get started? Everyone's getting antsy. 
<Megaman> Wait a minute! 
<Ace> Yeah? 
<Megaman> I don't understand. 
Why are you willing to go this far just to get a chance to battle with me? 
<Ace> There's something terrible coming... 
<Megaman> {13}{EC}...? 
<Ace> I need to see if you truly have the power to stop it. 
<Megaman> So then I'll be battling with your Wizard? 
<Ace> This time around, yes. 
<Megaman> This time? 
<Ace> I'll know fairly quickly, so let's get started... 
<Game> *alarm siren* 
<Megaman> It's the Security System again... 
{12}{E2}<Zack> {00}{00} 
<Mega> Another malfunction!? 
<Ace> No, something's happening... 
<Game> Attention, all <Spica.Mall> visitors! 
There is currently a Wizard within <Spica.Mall> that has gone out of control!! 
Please move to a safe area as quickly as possible! 
{10}{E2}{3B}{03} 
*Everyone, please calm down! 
As long as we don't leave this area we will be safe! 
<Megaman> A Wizard is running out of control!? 
<Ace> I've never heard of something like that before... 
<Megaman> We've got to stop it! Let's go, Mega! 
<Mega> Let's tear 'em up! 
<Ace> Looks like we'll have to postpone your little test. 
�What should we do, Ace? 
<Ace> Of course we're going, Acid. 
This is a good chance to see Mega Man's skills! 
�Understood.
