<Jack> Hey, Sis{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1}.{14}{E1} 
Did you know that if you make a wish on a shooting star three times before it 
burns out, then the wish will come true? 
<(Queen)Tia> {13}{EC}.{13}{E1}.{13}{E1}.{13}{E1}If so, then our wish will definitely come true. 
That red shooting star won't be burning out. 
At least not until this planet's final day. 
<Jack> Our{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1} wish{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{15}{E1}.{16}{E1}
