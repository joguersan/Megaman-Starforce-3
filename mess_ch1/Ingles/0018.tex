<Geo> Looks like it's set. 
Setting your first Team and Purpose is kind of moving. 
<Prez> Well, it's time to get started working as Team "Luna 4 Prez"! 
<Bud> But what can we do to help Prez become the student body president? 
<Zack> Hmm, good point. What should we do, Prez? 
<Prez> First, we should find kids here in the school who 
are having trouble and then help them out. 
Of course, I'll take all of the praise. 
Then my approval rating will skyrocket! 
Zack! 
You have a Wizard that is great with numbers, right? 
He's going to keep track of my approval rating, OK!? 
<Zack> Understood, Prez! 
<Zack> Wizard On! 
<Pedia> Thank you for calling me out, Zack! 
Everyone, my name is Pedia! You can leave any calculating to me! 
<Zack> We're an even stronger Team with Pedia around! 
<Pedia> My database is filled with a vast amount of facts! 
Plus, I can calculate any and all rankings and 
percentages possible, with ease! 
There is truly no figure I cannot calculate! 
<Bud> Wow! 
<Prez> You'll be very useful, Pedia! 
<Mega> *sigh* 
<Geo> Don't be like that, Mega! 
This school will be really fun with Prez as student body president! 
<Mega> You're such a sucker, kid... 
<Geo> Alright! Let's go find kids that are in trouble! 
<Zack> Yeah! 
<Bud> Let's go!
