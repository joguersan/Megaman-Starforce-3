Here you go.

<Prez>
Wow, you did it, Geo!
<PUSH>
Since we couldn't have
gotten it without you, I
<PUSH>
think you should be the
one to give it to the
Science Club.

Sure, sounds good.

They're Satella Police
Commandos!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

person before!

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
You don't know!?
They're Satella Police
Commandos!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
I have no clue what that
even means.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
They're an organization
directly under the control
of {51}{E2}.
<PUSH>
They deal with the EM
wave related crimes that
<PUSH>
have risen along with the
spread of Wizards and Real
Waves.
<PUSH>
Only the most skilled and
experienced members can
even think of joining.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Wow!
They sound really elite!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
They're so cool...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Boys really like that kind
of stuff, don't they?
I couldn't care less, really.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
You couldn't care less?
<PUSH>
We need to get you to
care if you want to be
our esteemed Team leader!

Would you like to hear a
complete history of the
Satella Police?

[SENTENCE NUMBER 5]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
No, that's OK!
<PUSH>
It's hard, but I'll do my
best to restrain my
enthusiasm...
<PUSH>
They don't really have
much to do with our Team
anyway.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 6]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Really, it's fine!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Yeah, I just know you'll be
moved by the great story
of the Satella Police!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
But it'll take way too long
to tell with the both of
you so crazy about it!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Ain't that the truth...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 7]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
0Are you OK, Eos?
Sorry we're late.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
No worries.
<PUSH>
More importantly, the Wizard
that went out of control
<PUSH>
dropped one of those
cards. It looks like they've
started to move.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
0That's how it looks, huh?
<PUSH>
That Wizard going out of
control made the Noise
Level spike quite high.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
That was their intent from
the beginning. We were
completely fooled.
<PUSH>
The same thing will probably
occur somewhere else
sooner or later.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
0Oh, yeah. Did you get to
fight Mega Man, Eos?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Ace>
No. We were about to
when the incident occurred.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
0Ah, no big deal I suppose.
<PUSH>
For now, let's maintain our
watch on Geo Stelar.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>
