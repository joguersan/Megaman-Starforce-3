<Megaman> Alright! We're all set! 
<Megaman> Weird... 
Don't I look a little different to you? 
<Mega> Now that you mention it... 
Maybe it's because your mobile terminal turned into a <Hunter>-VG? 
Don't worry about the little things, kid! 
Let's go delete those viruses! 
<Megaman> You got it! 
<Mega> The Cyber Cores of many things are connected to the Wave Road. 
You didn't forget, right? 
<Megaman> We can enter a Cyber Core by traveling to it on the Wave Road, right!? 
<Mega> You can get to the Sprinkler System CC from over there! 
When the "ACCESS" pop-up appears, touch it to trans in to the Cyber Core! 
<Megaman> OK, let's rock!
