<Geo>
W-What's wrong!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Geo!
For cryin' out loud!
<PUSH>
Let me know before you
ever do something like
upgrade your mobile terminal!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Huh?
<PUSH>
Why?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
What do you mean why!?
You should know!
<PUSH>
Thanks to the recent
advancements in wave
technology, I've become a
<PUSH>
Wizard, which is basically an
<CORPO.EM-color> that is integrated
into the mobile terminal!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yeah, of course I know
that much...
<PUSH>
You and the <Hunter>-VG are
intimately linked together.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Grr!!! Exactly!!!
<PUSH>
So if you make a change
to the system, then you
change me, too!
<PUSH>
Do you think it feels nice
to have a ton of data
shoved down your gullet?
<PUSH>
It was terrible!
Ohh...
<PUSH>
I don't feel so good all of
a sudden...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
S-Sorry!
I didn't think of that...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
No big deal, kid.
Just keep it in mind for
the future.
<PUSH>
By the way...
<PUSH>
Have you tried on your
<Visualizer-color> since EM wave
technology has advanced?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Huh?
Now that you mention it...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Well, try them on, kid.

<Mega>
When you put on your
<Visualizer>, you are able to
<PUSH>
see the "<Wave.Road>" and
even EM bodies.
<PUSH>
Regular people can't see
these phenomena.
<PUSH>
So, can you see anything?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-Visualizer>
Yeah, it works great!
<PUSH>
If my dad hadn't given me
this <Visualizer>, you and I
wouldn't have met, Mega.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
<Kelvin-color>...
Your father was a great
man, kid...
<PUSH>
And as they say,
"like father, like son."
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-Visualizer>
Hey, don't compare me to
my dad, OK?
<PUSH>
I need to make my own
path in life.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Heh, you sound like you're
growin' up, kid.
<PUSH>
Anyway...
You should try using the
<Visualizer> everywhere.
<PUSH>
Just press the Y Button
to use it anytime.
<PUSH>
Also, you won't be able to
see people while you're
using it. Just EM bodies.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-Visualizer>
Got it.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Well, you can kind of see
people, but it's pretty
difficult.
<PUSH>
Just be really careful when
walking around with the
<Visualizer> on.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo-Visualizer>
Alright.
