<Geo>
They look pretty down.
I wonder what's wrong?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Don't worry about them.
<PUSH>
Why don't you put on
your <Visualizer>, instead?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Huh? What's up?

[SENTENCE NUMBER 3]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Everything looks completely
different, doesn't it?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yeah...
When looking at the world
<PUSH>
this way, I can see that
the tree is a "Real Wave".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
These things are popping
up everywhere, lately.
<PUSH>
Real Waves are things that
are made from materialized
EM waves, right?
<PUSH>
I'm pretty sure Battle
Cards are also Real Waves.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
That's right. And nowadays,
EM waves are being used
<PUSH>
to make everything from
cars to buildings.

<Harry.Sasoon>
There's just no way, huh?

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack.Flask>
That's how it seems, eh?

Here you are, Geo.
Have you found anyone?

Well, umm...

Oh, those two look like
they are having some
trouble.
<PUSH>
Hey, you two!
Is there anything I can
help you with!?

[SENTENCE NUMBER 7]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Harry.Sasoon>
Well, you see...
<PUSH>
We want to give our
friend, Stey, a birthday
present.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
My, isn't that touching!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack.Flask>
Both of Stey's parents
have to work today, so
she's all alone.
<PUSH>
So, we want her to have
a really memorable
birthday.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Harry.Sasoon>
We were thinking we could
use this Real Wave tree.
<PUSH>
The plan is to overwrite
the tree's program to
make it bloom full of
<PUSH>
beautiful flowers, and then
show it to Stey.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
That's a great idea.
She'll be really happy!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Harry.Sasoon>
Yeah, but it seems that
the tree's program has a
<PUSH>
mega lock put on it by a
teacher.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Yeah?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Not you, "Mega".
It has a "mega lock" on
it.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 8]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
So...
Why don't you just ask
the teacher in charge?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack.Flask>
Well we want to, but...
<PUSH>
The teacher in charge is
incredibly scary.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Harry.Sasoon>
We're too scared to go up
to him...
Yeah...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
A scary teacher, huh?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
There's definitely a mega
lock on this.
Nothing will work for me.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 9]

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
You should do something
for them, Geo!
<PUSH>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 10]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
M-Me!?
B-But they said the
teacher is scary...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
That's probably because
he's an adult. That's no
reason to be scared!
<PUSH>
Remember, this is for our
Purpose!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I guess I have no choice.
(No excuse I use is going
 to work on her...)
<PUSH>
That scary teacher should
still be at school, so let's
search around here first.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
You're a tough one, kid.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>
