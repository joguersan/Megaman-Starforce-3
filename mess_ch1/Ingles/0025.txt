<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Oh, you know each other?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yeah, we met on the roof
earlier today.
<PUSH>
Their club's Purpose is
"Launch a Rocket".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
If you're already familiar,
then I can explain very
quickly.
<PUSH>
Geo! Bud! Zack!
<PUSH>
Team "Luna 4 Prez" is
going to manage the
construction of the rocket!
<PUSH>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 3]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Interesting...
<PUSH>
By "manage" you mean
oversee and help with all
things in general, right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
But Prez!
That's impossible!
<PUSH>
We don't know anything
about this kind of stuff!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
It's true that construction
of a rocket is very
<PUSH>
complicated, but this rocket
is just about finished.
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 4]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
All we need to complete
the process is a
Giga Energy Card.
<PUSH>
If we just had that we
could perform the launch.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
A Giga Energy Card?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Yes.
I think we should have
Magnes explain.
<PUSH>
Come on out, Magnes!
<PUSH>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 5]

<START-DIALOG>

<Magnes>
Yup!
I'm Magnes!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Are you a Wizard?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Magnes>
Yup!
I'm a Wizard!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Awesome!
I didn't know there were
rocket specialist Wizards!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Magnes>
Yup!
<PUSH>
I'm going to act as the
brain and pilot of the
rocket for its space flight!
<PUSH>
But, as Woody said, we
still need one more item
to complete the rocket.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
A Giga Energy Card, right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Magnes>
Yup...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 6]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Magnes>
We are going to use both
fuel and my magnetic
<PUSH>
abilities to launch the
rocket. But that's still not
enough.
<PUSH>
A Giga Energy Card would
give us the power needed
to successfully launch.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
So you can't move on
without it...
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 7]

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Magnes>

<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>

Giga Energy Cards are
used mainly by police and
the government.
<PUSH>
Most civilians have never
even seen one.

<Geo>
P-Prez!
That's no good!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
We have to run a clean
campaign!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
What's the matter?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Everyone will see it as
bribery!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
I'm very thankful, but one
can't simply buy a
Giga Energy Card.
<PUSH>
They are too powerful to
be legally sold to civilians.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Saying elementary school
students are going to use
it for a school club won't...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Totally impossible...

other way, right?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Pedia>
Unfortunately, there is only
a one percent chance of
acquiring one.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Unless a miracle occurs...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
We can't just give up
after they've come so far.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Geo is right.
