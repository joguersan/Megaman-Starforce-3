About EM Wave Changes...

technology...

We can do it anywhere!

It looks like we were
registered with the

And that we won't be able
to EM Wave Change so
easily anymore.
<PUSH>
I'm not really sure, but
it seems like we need to

use the code "Mega Man"
when we EM Wave Change.
<PUSH>
Don't worry about it
too much for now, OK?

Let's do this thing!
Use the R Button to
