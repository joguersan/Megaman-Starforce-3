<Geo>
Done!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
Is everyone finished?
<PUSH>
OK, now I'll explain the
pop-up system to everyone.
<PUSH>
Please get into small
groups.

[SENTENCE NUMBER 2]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
Is everyone ready?
<PUSH>
OK, I'm going to start the
explanation now.
<PUSH>
As I'm sure everyone
already knows...
<PUSH>
There is a massive amount
of information in the world.
<PUSH>
Actually, there is too much
information for people to
handle.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
I so understand that!
<PUSH>
My room is so messy that
I can't find my pants in
the morning!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
It's because your room looks
like it got hit by a tornado,
<Bud-color>!
<PUSH>
You really need to clean it
up big time!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Watch it, <Zack-color>!
It's MY room!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
Haha, actually Bud gave a
good example.
<PUSH>
In short...
<PUSH>
When you need to find
something quickly, there is
no time to waste.
<PUSH>
And it's very hard to find
what you need in a huge
pile of data.
<PUSH>
The new pop-up system
makes finding things much
easier.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
A-Awesome!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mary.McLovin>
Mr. Shepar!
<PUSH>
When is the pop-up system
accessible?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
Why don't you try talking
to the people in your
group?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mary.McLovin>
OK! Geo, can you try saying
something to me, please?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Sure.
<PUSH>

[SENTENCE NUMBER 4]
{00}{EC}{02}{00}
<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Whoa!
Something popped up on
the bottom screen!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
What just appeared on
everyone's <Hunter>-VG is
called a pop-up.
<PUSH>
As I said earlier, a pop-up
shows you important
information.
<PUSH>
This pop-up is showing who
you're talking to.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Their school emblem even
pops up above.

<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
Touching the pop-up will
make more information
about the person appear.
<PUSH>
Why don't you try touching
the pop-up?

[SENTENCE NUMBER 5]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Cool!
Even if we just met for
the first time, I would
<PUSH>
know she is Mary McLovin
from Echo Ridge Elementary.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.Shepar>
There are also many other
pop-up types.
<PUSH>
For example, standing in
front of an elevator will
make choices appear.
<PUSH>
Touch the desired destination
to go there automatically.
<PUSH>
The more you try it, the
quicker you will get used
to it.
<PUSH>
OK, that's everything for
now! If you have questions
<PUSH>
about your <Hunter>-VG or
EM waves, please feel
free to ask.
<PUSH>

The upgrade deleted your
Brother Bands.

Brother Bands with your

Everyone be safe on the
way home!

[SENTENCE NUMBER 8]

So my Brother Bands have
been deleted...
<PUSH>
I better go re-form them

<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
(Is it OK if I come out
 for a bit?)
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
(What? No way!)
<PUSH>
(People will notice if you
 come out here!)
<PUSH>
(It's different now that
 people can see you!)
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
(Well, then get us to a
 place where it won't be
 a problem!)
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
(Hmph! What's the big hurry
 all of a sudden, anyway?)
<PUSH>
(I have some questions
 that I want to ask
 Mr. Shepar...)
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
(Go ahead, but let's get
 outta here ASAP!)
<PUSH>
(If you forget anything,
 just press the L Button
 and I'll help you out!)
<PUSH>
(I'll make sure you know
 what you need to do!
 Got it!?)
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yeah, I got it...
<PUSH>
(So where's a place I can
 go that Mega won't be
 noticed...?)
<PUSH>
(Hmm, how about the roof?)
<PUSH>
