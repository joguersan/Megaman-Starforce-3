<Megaman> Huh...? The road's cut off. I can't go any further... 
<Mega> That stuff flowing in front of us must be the 
magnetic force that Prez mentioned before. 
We'd be able to move ahead if we could ride it somehow. 
We could use that Coil guy's help right about now. 
<Megaman> Yeah, but how do we get ahold of him? 
<Game> Sorry for the wait! 
<Coil> Word! I'm Coil, Woody's other Wizard! 
You can leave all your magnetism problems to me! 
<Megaman> I'm Mega Man! Nice to meet you! 
<Coil> Word! 
<Megaman> I need to keeping moving ahead, but I don't know how to... 
<Coil> Word! Why don't you hop on that special panel over there! 
<Mega> Hey, it looks like something popped up on the Hunter's screen. 
<Coil> Why don't you touch the pop-up! Word! 
<Megaman> Whoa! 
<Mega> ...Interesting. 
<Coil> Word! Now there is magnetic force all around Mega Man! 
<Coil> Right now, you are aligned with the blue negative force. 
This will make the red positive force pull you toward it. 
<Coil> With magnetism, the same colors repel each other, and different ones attract! 
If you get to a place where you can't move ahead again, hop on top 
of the special panel and touch the pop-up! 
That'll change your magnetic force! Word! 
<Megaman> Got it! Thanks! 
<Coil> Word! Please save my bro, yo! 
<Mega> Let's go, kid! 
<Megaman> Yeah!
