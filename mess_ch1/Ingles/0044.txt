<Jack>
But, Sis...
<PUSH>
At least our test using
the Noise Card to make
<PUSH>
the Wizard go out of
control was a success.
<PUSH>
And we got the stuff
that we wanted.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
That's right...
We did pretty well...
<PUSH>
Let's perform an even
bigger test next time.

Mega Man is there...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<(Queen)Tia>
So that means Mega Man
is the one who stopped
the rocket from exploding?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King>
That is correct.
<PUSH>
The both of you, listen
very carefully.
<PUSH>
You are to infiltrate the
school and investigate
Mega Man.
<PUSH>
You will find the secret
of his power, as well as
his weaknesses.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Instead of doing all that
boring stuff, why don't we
just take him out?
<PUSH>
He's our enemy after all,
isn't he?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mr.King>
I am not considering taking
him down at the moment.
<PUSH>
Mega Man will prove to be
quite the interesting test
subject for me.
<PUSH>
As a scientist, I am
interested in learning more
about him.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack>
Ha! I thought I'd get the
chance to have some fun
for once!

I am sending some data.
Read it over thoroughly.
