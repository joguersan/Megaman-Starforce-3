<Geo> Alright, we're ready to go! 
<Hope(Mom)> Oh, are you going out today, Geo? 
<Geo> Hey, Mom. 
Yeah, I'm going with my friends to <Spica.Mall>. 
<Hope(Mom)> Alright. Just be safe, OK? 
Take care of him, Mega. 
<Mega> You can count on me! 
By the way, where's the Echo Ridge Wicket? 
<Hope(Mom)> It's by the river. 
But it doesn't really stand out very much. 
<Mega> By the river, huh? Let's get a move on, kid! 
<Mega> Don't worry, Hope! 
I won't let anything happen to the kid! 
<Hope(Mom)> I know I can count on you, Mega. 
<Geo> {13}{EC}(Why are you being so  energetic in front of  Mom today, Mega?) 
<Hope(Mom)> Well, be safe and don't stay out so late this time!
