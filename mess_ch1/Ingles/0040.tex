<Megaman> So this is the Rocket CC? 
Magnes should be up ahead! 
<Megaman> Ah, a phone call... 
<Prez> Geo... Uh, I mean... Mega Man! 
<Megaman> What is it, Prez? 
<Prez> I just heard from Woody that the Rocket CC has 
a very powerful magnetic force. 
So he wants to send in his Wizard to help... 
<Megaman> Woody's Wizard? 
<Prez> Yes, Magnes' little brother. His name is Coil. 
He can help in places where you can't move 
ahead due to the powerful magnetic force. 
<Megaman> Thanks, Prez! Tell Woody thanks for me! 
<Prez> You can do it, Mega Man! 
<Mega> Let's move, kid! 
We've got to stop the rocket from exploding! 
<Megaman> Got it!
