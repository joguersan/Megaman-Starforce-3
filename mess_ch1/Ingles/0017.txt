We've finally re-formed
our Brother Bands!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Now we can form our
Team and set our Purpose!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
But before that don't we
need some kind of Team
name or something?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
How about "Team Tortellini"?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Since our Purpose is
"Luna for SBPrez", the
<PUSH>
Team name should be
related to that.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Fine! Just ignore me!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
There's no need to worry
everyone!
<PUSH>
I've already come up with
a Team name!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Prez is always on top of
things like this!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
I couldn't sleep at all last
night thinking about it!
<PUSH>
But I, of course, was able
to come up with a brilliant
Team name!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Well, let's hear it!

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I'm kind of speechless...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
She stayed up all night
to come up with that?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
To be honest, Prez never
was good at coming up
with names.
<PUSH>
I once had her think of a
name for my first pet.
...Poor Catnip.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Catnip because he's a cat...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
No.
<PUSH>
Catnip is a dog...
*sigh*
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
What is everyone muttering
about?
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

N-Nothing at all!

It's a great name!

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Game>
Geo's Team and Purpose
have been set!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Looks like it's set.
<PUSH>
Setting your first Team
and Purpose is kind of
moving.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
Well, it's time to get
started working as Team
"Luna 4 Prez"!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
But what can we do to
help Prez become the
student body president?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Hmm, good point.
What should we do, Prez?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
First, we should find kids
here in the school who
<PUSH>
are having trouble and
then help them out.
<PUSH>
Of course, I will do all of
the helping.
<PUSH>
Then my approval rating
will skyrocket!
<PUSH>
Zack!
<PUSH>
You have a Wizard that is
great with numbers, right?
<PUSH>
He's going to keep track
of my approval rating, OK!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Understood, Prez!
<PUSH>

We're an even stronger
Team with Pedia around!

<Pedia>
My database is filled with
a vast amount of facts!
<PUSH>
Plus, I can calculate any
and all rankings and
<PUSH>
percentages possible,
with ease!
<PUSH>
There is truly no figure
I cannot calculate!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Wow!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Prez>
You'll be very useful, Pedia!
<PUSH>
I really want to get my
own Wizard ASAP!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Bud>
Wow!
I'm really jealous, Zack!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Zack>
Don't say that, Bud...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
*sigh*
<PUSH>

Don't be like that, Mega!

This school will be really
