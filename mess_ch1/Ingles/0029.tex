<Geo> So this is <Spica.Mall>!? 
What a cool place. I'm really excited! 
<Zack> According to Pedia... 
It was constructed with financial support from the "King Foundation". 
It's meant to be a place that inspires children to smile and just be kids. 
<Prez> That's the King Foundation headed by Mr. King, right? 
My father has been talking about him a lot lately. 
He and the foundation believe that no amount of 
money is a waste when making children happy. 
<Geo> That's really amazing... 
<Bud> Who cares about that stuff anyway!? 
Is there somewhere we can get some grub!? 
<Zack> Bud, our goal here is to get the Giga Energy Card. 
<Prez> The {BD}{E4} is over there. Let's get going! 
The tournament has already started!
