Hey!
It seems that the

<Jack.Flask>
Woo hoo!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Angel.Wise>
But, we're soaking wet!

[SENTENCE NUMBER 2]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Yeah, that's true...
Unfortunately, I think we
should postpone the launch.
<PUSH>
Remember, there's always
tomorrow!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack.Flask>
Oh yeah! Now that I think
about it... I saw someone!
<PUSH>
I saw a boy wearing blue
enter the Sprinkler when it
was going out of control!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
{13}{EC}Ack!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
What!?
That had to be Mega Man!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Angel.Wise>
Amazing!
You mean THE Mega Man?
As in, our hero!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Could the rumors that he
goes to this school really
be true?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
{13}{EC}(T-This is bad! I've got to
 stop this conversation
 before it gets crazy!)
<PUSH>
E-Excuse me!

[SENTENCE NUMBER 3]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
What kind of experiment
were you conducting?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Oh, we were attempting to
launch a rocket.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
A rocket!?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Yeah, we're building a
rocket in the 2nd Floor
Sci. Club Room.
<PUSH>
But it's not going so well.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Jack.Flask>
We thought we'd run some
tests on a smaller version
<PUSH>
made from the same
materials.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
As the Science Club, we
have formed a Team with
<PUSH>
the "Purpose" to 
"Launch a Rocket".

I know we will be
successful in fulfilling

..."Purpose"?
<PUSH>
What does that mean?
<PUSH>

<END-DIALOG>

[END]

[SENTENCE NUMBER 5]

<START-DIALOG>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I guess you could say that
a Purpose is a "goal".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
A "goal"...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
The Purpose function is a
new function that has
evolved the Brother Bands
<PUSH>
that bond friends together.
It's becoming pretty common
as of late.
<PUSH>
After deciding a goal you
want to achieve or a
<PUSH>
dream you want to come
true, you can set it as a
"<Proposito-color>" and then form
<PUSH>
a "<Squadra-color>" with others who
share the same Purpose.

Umm, hehe...

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Oh yeah, I haven't
introduced myself yet.
<PUSH>
My name is Woodrow Boffin.
I'm in 6th grade right now.
<PUSH>
People usually call me
"Woody".
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I'm Geo Stelar.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
Geo, eh?
Do you have any Purposes
at the moment, Geo?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Me?
N-Not really...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Woody>
I see.
<PUSH>
Well I hope that you find
a great Purpose and do
<PUSH>
your best to fulfill it with
your friends someday!
<PUSH>
We are definitely going to
fulfill our Purpose to 
"Launch a Rocket"!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
I don't know anything about
rockets, but I can at least
cheer you on!

<Mega>
What's wrong, kid?
You look a little depressed.

Talking about the rocket
made me think about Dad.
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
Kelvin, huh?
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
He's still missing in space
even after all this time...
<PUSH>
But Mom and I believe
that he is still alive
somewhere...
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
There's no doubt about it,
he's still alive, kid...
<PUSH>
The Kelvin I met in space
isn't someone who would
keel over so easily!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Geo>
Yeah, you're right!
<PUSH>

<NEW-DIALOG>
<Mega>
By the way...
Didn't you have something
you had to do?
