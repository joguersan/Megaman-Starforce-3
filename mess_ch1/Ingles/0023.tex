<Megaman> You're fine now. 
tTHANK YOU SO MUCH! 
THIS IS ACTUALLY MY FIRST DAY OF WORK! 
I WOULD HAVE GOT INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH 
MY BOSS IF THAT VIRUS CAUSED ANY PROBLEMS! 
I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU SOMEHOW, BUT I 
HAVE TO DELIVER THIS E-MAIL IMMEDIATELY... 
<Megaman> An e-mail...? Is that an e-mail from a girl at Echo Ridge Elementary? 
tTHAT'S CORRECT! 
SINCE IT'S MY FIRST DAY, I WAS GIVEN A LOW PRIORITY E-MAIL. 
BECAUSE THIS MAIL ISN'T BUSINESS RELATED IT WAS MARKED AS LOW PRIORITY. 
<Mega> Hey, Geo... 
<Megaman> Yeah, it has to be! That girl's e-mail was stuck on the Wave Road! 
tI REALLY MUST BE GOING, BUT THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH! 
<Megaman> Alright, the e-mail should arrive safely now! 
Let's get back to the girl at school!
