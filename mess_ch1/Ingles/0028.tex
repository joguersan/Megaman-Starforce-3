<Zack> This is just like Bud... 
<Prez> What if we can't get the Giga Energy Card because we get there too late? 
<Bud> Sorry I'm late! 
<Bud> I'm really, really sorry! 
<Prez> For cryin' out loud! We missed a train waiting for you! 
<Geo> The next train is here, guys! 
<Prez> Let's get on, everyone!
